            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T cannot be unknown to any man who hath either carefully obſerved the manners of Mankind, or perufed the Writings of thoſe of this preſent Age, who have made many ſad Declarations againſt the general Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the World; that either men are ſtupidly and blockiſhly Ignorant, even in theſe dayes wherein Knowledge ſo much abounds; or <hi>their Leaders have cauſed them to Err,</hi> by inſtilling into them ſuch Principles, as may fairly conſiſt with the practice of Vice and Immorality; which eaſing them of that te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious burden of ſevere Mortification, and ſharpe Conflicts with the irregular and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate motions of ſenſe and the bodily life; ſoon captivated them to the embracing of
<pb facs="tcp:42065:3"/> them, and made a ſpeedy conqueſt of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary Judgments; and ſo infinitely prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their minds againſt the reception of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sentiments and Notions, that they cannot believe either the ſenſe of the moſt pious and venerable Antiquity, or of our own preſent Church to be Orthodox. And I wiſh I could ſay that this latter hath not been the greater cauſe of thoſe monſtrous Impieties, which in theſe late times ſo much prevailed amongſt us; For certainly, mens natural Faculties and Capacities, are no whit worſe for the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Truth, if it were rightly and duely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them, than former ages: but might be much better, if every Preacher of the Goſpel, and Steward of the Myſteries of God, had faithfully diſcharged the truſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him. But when thoſe that took upon them the title of <hi>Evangelical Shepherds,</hi> came not in at the right door, but impudently challenged and uſurped that Sacred Office and Dignity, of being Co-workers with Chriſt the chief Shepherd, in that great work of implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his own life and lovely Nature in the lapſed and degenerate ſouls of men, it is no wonder if the Flock went aſtray, and became faint and weak through the unwholeſomeneſs or undue order and proportion of their food. And doubtleſs the bleſſed Jeſus who came into the World to heal and cement the broken ruins
<pb facs="tcp:42065:3"/> and decayes of our Natures, did not intend to bring this Heroick undertaking to perfection by perpetual Miracles, but by a natural and orderly Method; and therefore, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, before he left the World, breathed on his Apoſtles, and gave them Commiſſion both to Teach and Govern his Church: So did they (having received Authority from the Prince and Head of the Catholick Church, the Lord Chriſt) Ordain and Conſtitute fit perſons to ſucceed them in that Function; by which we are ſufficiently inſtructed, that it is not for every man to take upon him the Office of a Miniſter of the Goſpel, leſt God take as little delight in him, as he did in thoſe Prophets of old, who run before they were ſent, (which too many did in the late times, upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſome inſpired Excellency and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection above their Brethren) but only for thoſe that come into their Office by a regular and due manner; and according to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws, and Apoſtolick Conſtitutions of the Church wherein they live. I may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore refer the Miſcarriages obſerved amongst us, to theſe two General Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> The great Pride and Self-conceitedneſs which reigns in vulgar ſpirits, whereby they make their vainglorious Minds the eſtimate of their Perfections, and by puffie conceits of themſelves, crumble into infinite Sects and
<pb facs="tcp:42065:4"/> Diviſions, and he that can beſt act the part of an inſpired perſon, and cant moſt fluently in Scripture expreſſions, becomes the Ring leader of the Sect. And what gives greater occaſion to this, then that pleaſant Doctrin to carnal minds, which teaches them, that when they can but collect themſelves to be heirs of heaven, and fancy their names enrolled among the Stars, they are then ſafe enough; They ſhall tread upon the young Lyon and the Dragon, and the enemy ſhall never be able to move or diſturbe their reſt. And all this ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd upon them without any attempts or endeavours of their own toward the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of it: This cannot but fill their ſailes, and blow up their light heads, when they conſider how eaſily they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained heaven, and how God himſelf by a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and diſcriminating love hath ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated them from the reſt of the polluted rabble of mankinde, and dignified them with the title of his <hi>Beloved Ones.</hi> And (as the Nature of every Hereſie is to diffuſe and ſpread it ſelf, and by a contagious affriction, ſavour all capable Subjects round about it: no ſooner is this Doctrine propounded, but it findes good entertainment by the unſtable and injudicious; becauſe it complies with, and patronizes their darling Vices, and renders it ſelf very grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Animal Life; and withal requires
<pb facs="tcp:42065:4"/> no great pains or labour to be fully inſtructed in it; nothing that ſhall rouze them up from their deadly ſlumber, or moleſt their deſired ſecurity; the whole buſineſs is nothing but an inactive and eaſie belief of certain propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and a delight ſome application of them to themſelves; and then Heaven cannot fail of being their portion, and reward. Thus while they ſoar aloft, and fly in their vain dreams and imaginations, they are really ſuckt into a living Hell of woe and miſery: and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous nature, whoſe counſels are the very inſpirations of that bottomleſs-pit, takes grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hold upon them; and having no ſubſtantial foundation to bottom themſelves upon, they periſh in a ſtorm, and the windes of adverſe fortune ſink them, even when they think themſelves in the haven of Felicity. True goodneſs and righteouſneſs cannot conſiſt with a proud and haughty ſpirit, and is neuer found but in that humble Temper which the Bleſſed Jeſus recommended to all his followers, when he ſaid, <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek, and lowly of heart.</hi> And certainly 'tis the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <hi>Obex,</hi> and impediment to real and ſolid wiſdom that poſſibly can be imagined, when we are impatient of inſtruction, and refuſe ſuch wholeſome precepts and counſels, as tend to the building of us up in our moſt holy Faith; and by high-flown imaginations climb to the
<pb facs="tcp:42065:5"/> higheſt boughs of the tree of knowledge, when we are yet unacquainted with the Rudiments of Chriſtianity. The way to life and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs lies not in the ſelf-choſen tracts of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, nor in ſequeſtring our ſelves from the reſt of the world by an impertinent contention about words and names; things of no value or concern in compariſon of thoſe momentous and great aims of Religion in perfecting the ſoul in Juſtice, Righteouſneſs, and Goodneſs; theſe only will give free acceſs to Heaven, when the nice ſpeculations of curious Wits, devoid of purity and innocency, whiter then the light and ſnow, are not able to waft the ſoul over the perturbed caſualties and adverſe occurrences which are the genuine productions of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior region of Mutability. God is not taken with ſhadows of Holineſs, nor pleaſed with Enthuſiaſtick heats, and Paroxyſms of furious zeal: but with thoſe mild and gentle moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are begotten and raiſed up by that internal Veſtal fire, that perpetually burns bright within it's own Orbe, and ſpends it's Celeſtial vigor and activity, either in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption or converſion into it's own nature, of whatever is ſtubborn and inobſequious to thoſe laws which are the foundation of it's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and thus amplifies and enlarges it's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion by the new acceſſion of ſuperadvenient forces from it's now-conquered enemies. The
<pb facs="tcp:42065:5"/> true Chriſtian deſcends not ſo low, as to make himſelf a party againſt any one (be he of what Judgment or Opinion he will in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters af ſpeculation and lubricous uncertainty) who ſincerely follows the dictates of his great Lord and Maſter, whoſe Birth was uſher'd in with an Anthem of Peace and Goodwil amongst men, ſung by an Angelick Quire, and his life ſpent in diffuſions of Charity, and in uniting the hearts of all mankind to the firſt and ever-bleſſed Author of all things. The firſt cauſe of evil to the ſons of men was, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>That they would be their own, or themſelves,</hi> as the Philoſopher ſpeaks: And now that we are Inhabitants of the earth, thoſe wrinkles which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the aged and polluted brow of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhew themſelves; and every man looks upon himſelf as a particular being, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and ſeparated from the reſt of the World, and ſent hither to manage and carry on the cauſe of ſelf-intereſt; and being thus principled, hates all inſtruction to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſcorns to be reformed: And through this exceſſive <hi>Faſtus</hi> and ſwelling pride, the great fomentors of Debates and Contentions, the whole Earth is over-run with Cruelty and Barbarity; For, from whence come Wars and Bloodſhed, but from that unquiet and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent ſpirit which cannot reſt within it's
<pb facs="tcp:42065:6"/> own Sphear; but by tumultuous and giddy motions, ſhakes the Peace and Tranquillity of all round about it? Thoſe wounds which this Nation not long ago received in her body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick, the ſcars of which are not worn out to this day, are too ſad and ſure an evidence of thoſe direful effects which Pride and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion produce; eſpecially when cheriſhed by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Knowledge, and the unruly and rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious flames of miſtaken Zeal. And when the unerring and Allcomprehenſive Providence of God, which rules and governs the affairs of this inferiour World, was pleaſed to permit the pride and malice of prophane and immoral perſons, to ariſe to that hight of impiety and brutiſhneſs, as, in defiance of heaven, in deſpight of the loud clamours of their own conſciences, and without any ſenſe or regard to the common intereſt and Good of the Nation, whereof themſelves made an unworthy part, to take away by wicked hands the life of our late <hi>Gratious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,</hi> thereby drawing a mask and veil over the beautious face of our Church; which like the <hi>Heliotrope,</hi> muſt needs cloſe up her leaves in penſiveneſs and ſorrow, when the Sun that cheared and enlivened her by his kindly influence, was ſet and withdrawn from our Horizon; then, I ſay, did Wickedneſs and Irreligion, deluge and overſpread the whole
<pb facs="tcp:42065:6"/> body Politick, like the wild Ocean breaking through it's antient bounds, and with a foaming rage ſwallowing up whole regions at once: and indeed little elſe could be expected when once the walls and banks, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained and curb'd it's luxuriant pride, were overturned and broken down: Then was Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy ſtigmatiz'd with the infamous title of Tyranny, and Epiſcopacy (which excellent and well-temper'd Conſtitution, both Reaſon and Scripture averr to be Apoſtolical) ſtyled Antichriſtianiſm, and new-model'd Popery; and thoſe, who out of a ſenſe of faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, and generous Loyalty and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to their Prince, could not comply with thoſe impious Deſigns, and unchriſtian Projects then ſet on foot, were accounted Schiſmaticks and Diſſenters from the publick intereſt: And what was it gave birth to theſe tragick Scenes of ſorrow and diſorder, but only the reſtleſs and unſtable ſpirits of injudicious perſons, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puffed up with aſpiring thoughts, and the fantaſtick images of Glory and Ambition, caſt an envious eye upon every tranſaction, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Church or State, that did not compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe with their intereſt, and ſuit with the ill-contrivances of things their buſie minds had been working out? And that the Goſpel which carries Peace in it's forefront, and owns no other Parent but the Prince of Peace, all
<pb facs="tcp:42065:7"/> whoſe productions are like himſelf, ſhould be made to give an alarm of Rebellion and War, is the moſt audacious piece of treachery to God, and uncharitableneſs to Men, in the World; as if God were more pleaſed with the title of the <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> then in being ſtyled the <hi>Father of Mercies,</hi> order and conſolation throughout the earth. Surely, he that once ſaid, <hi>By me Kings Reign, and Princes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree Juſtice,</hi> did likewiſe command, to be ſubject to them, and honor them; as being accountable to him alone, for the management of the truſt committed to them. And it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a greater reproach and ſcandal, to that peaceable Religion we profeſs, then to ſee thoſe that own it, and ſeem to contend moſt for it, to be ſuch ill practitioners of thoſe plain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Obedience to our lawful Magiſtrates, and by varniſhing them over with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted Gloſſes of their corrupt minds, make them ſpeak what they never intended in the leaſt to countenance or favour.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> The ſecond General cauſe of our Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, is the precipitant and inconſiderate Zeal and Fervour of thoſe who took upon them to inſtruct the people, which draw along with it many evil and pernicious conſequences. And though I have ſo much Charity as to think, that moſt of them directed their labours, in that kind, to the glory of God, and made that the
<pb facs="tcp:42065:7"/> ultimate end and reſult of their Preaching; yet, there is a zeal which is without knowledge and judgment, and the intereſt of Religion is not then beſt advanced, when her Prieſts (from whoſe lips ſhould flow wiſdom) are moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant. But that I may not ſeem to charge them only with Generals, I will diſcend to ſome more particular Conſiderations upon this head; by which it will eaſily appear, with what great indiſcretion they managed that high af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair they undertook.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Therefore they exceedingly erred in propounding to their Charge, ſuch crude and uncocted Doctrines, as (beſides the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of them with the principles of Reaſon, and Truths of firſt inſcription, and incoherence with the Divine Attributes, (then which, nothing can be excogitated more infallible for the Exploration of whatever falls under hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane cognizance) which is, in ſome meaſure, made good in the following Diſcourſe) they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe put a certain ſtop to the progreſs of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity throughout the World, and are the greateſt impediment to the diſſemination of the Goſpel, to them that are without; it being given to be the Religion of all mankind, to run and be glorious, and to conquer and ſubdue the Nations to the entertainment of it. For, unleſs we will imagine men ſo ſtupid, and ignorantly devotional, that they will embrace
<pb facs="tcp:42065:8"/> any thing, though never ſo diſagreeing with the native ſentiments of their own minds; it is impoſſible they ſhould ever give any real and unfaigned aſſent to ſuch <hi>Dogmata</hi> of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, as pretend to no other Author, but the Eternal <hi>Logos</hi> and Wiſdom of God, and are propounded to rational and intellectual crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures endued with a diſcriminative ſenſe and perception between truth and falſhood; and yet, by all the reaſon that is in them, cannot make them to appear ſo. And though the Doctrins themſelves ſhould not be in their whole frame and contexture irrational, yet if we give abſurd and inconcinnous explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them, there will be as ſmall hope and expectation that any man ſhould be convinced and perſwaded by them, as if they were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether falſe. Such is the intellectual Fabrick of mens minds, that they cannot believe or disbelieve what they will; but there are certain laws and principles interwoven in the eſſential frame of their Natures by the great Architect of all things, by which they are bound up and limited, and which are the foundations of all Knowledge, whether Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, Moral, or Metaphyſical. And 'tis very ſtrange to think, that infinite Wiſdom, which alone works conſtantly and evenly, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the capacities and meaſures of creatures, ſhould now in this grand Myſtery
<pb facs="tcp:42065:8"/> of the recovery of the World, which of all things is the moſt like that high and incomprehenſible intellect, which gave birth unto it, ſo deviate from the unchangeable laws of it's own being, as to propound ſuch Articles and Propoſitions to the World, which without the greateſt reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and violation of their Natural Powers and Faculties, they can never fully credit or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. And queſtionleſs ſuch a way and method of proceeding would ſo miſerably confound the beautiful Order and Symmetry of things, that beſide it muſt neceſſarily engage the Divine Power to the production of a perpetual Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle for the begetting Faith and Aſſent in men; it likewiſe layes them open and obnoxious to inevitable Errors, Falſities and Deluſions, and there will be no means left for the attaining to the truth of any thing. And now let any man conſider, what little probability or plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of reaſon there is, that ſuch a Doctrine as this, whether poſitively declared ſo in it ſelf, or made ſo by the perverſe Gloſſes, and Paraphraſtical Expoſitions of others, ſhould win and gain ground upon the World, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that purpoſe for which it was at firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>It was the advice and counſel of the Apoſtle <hi>1 Cor. x. 32.</hi> that we give no offence either to the <hi>Jew,</hi> or to the <hi>Greek,</hi> whereby to alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate their minds from ſo excellent a Religion;
<pb facs="tcp:42065:9"/> for there is nothing ſo much obſtructs the diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any Principles or <hi>Dogmata,</hi> be they of what ſort they will, as when they contain ſomething which may adminiſter juſt cauſe of ſcruple, and beget an averſion to it in the mind of a rational and unprejudic'd perſon. He therefore that would bring over a free and ingenuous Spirit, whether Jew or Heathen to Chriſtianity, muſt be ſure that he aſſert nothing Dogmatically, or poſitively lay it down as an indiſpenſable Article of the Chriſtian Faith, which the other can reject upon clear and ſolid grounds of Reaſon; for, aſſuredly, no part of Chriſtianity can be repugnant to Right Reaſon. Therefore to begin with the Jew, who taking juſt exceptions againſt many <hi>Dogmata</hi> of Chriſtianity, as they are in common vogue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us: but particularly diſguſting that harſh and rigid Doctrine of <hi>Inconditionate Reprobation,</hi> expreſſes his diſlike and diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in ſuch like terms as theſe;
<q>That God gave Statutes, and Judgments, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered a Law to <hi>Moſes</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> I am ſufficiently convinced of, from the conſtant and uninterrupted Tradition of our Fathers, and that I am equally obliged to perform due obedience to it, is in my apprehenſion a truth as indubitable as the other: But that I ſhould deſert the Religion of my Anceſtors, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a Novel Doctrine wholly repugnant to,
<pb facs="tcp:42065:9"/> and inconſiſtent not only with the common principles of Reaſon, but the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and Prophetick Writings, and manifeſtly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the everſion and extirpation of all Religion in the World (for, who will put his truſt in that God who takes greater pleaſure in Deſtroying, than in Saving of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?) will argue as great Impiety, as it will appear Fantaſtickneſs and Imprudence in the eyes of all that believe a God and Providence in the World. For under the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Oeconomy, God like a juſt and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Legiſlator, makes the ground and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all his Promiſes and Menaces, to be the Obedience or Diſobedience of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and Benefits are not conferred but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothetically, and with reſpect to the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on annexed to them; nor Puniſhments exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, but upon the actual breach and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Law: And beſide this, you tell us, that when the Meſſias comes, he will bring into the World ſuch a Religion and Service as will moſt ſuit with our rational and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Natures, ſuch as may approve it ſelf to our inward and divine ſenſe as truly excellent and lovely, comprehending the flower and ſumme of whatever is Worthy, Noble, and Generous; which, you ſay, is moſt lively depainted and ſet out to us in that which you call the Chriſtian Religion, the great <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canum</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:42065:10"/> and Myſtery of which (according to the principles of your Doctrine) ſeems to be this, That God hath eternally Elected a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of perſons to inherit Bleſſedneſs with him, and ſent his ſon to ſignifie the ſame to them, and to publiſh this his decree: but to caſt away the reſt upon the pretence of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty and Dominion over them; either therefore the coming of Chriſt is upon rational grounds yet expected, or if he have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready manifeſted to the World, your Religion is none of his, nor was he ever the Author of it, but the ſpurious reſults and effuxes of fanciful perſons obtruded as neceſſary Articles of faith upon the World. It is impoſſible I ſhould ever believe, that the great Creator of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, who in our Law declared himſelf to be The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering and abundant in goodneſs; and who ſo often forgat the Crimes and Apoſtacies of our Forefathers, when they returned and ſought him with their whole heart, ſhould now ſo change his Nature, and ſuſpend the rayes and benign emanations of his commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative life, in this which you affirm to be the laſt and moſt perfect manifeſtation of himſelf, as not only without any regard had of their juſt provocations, but even before they became ſons of ſenſe and were born in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, to Reprobate the farr greateſt
<pb facs="tcp:42065:10"/> part of Mankind, and make them the unhappy objects of his endleſs diſpleaſure. And ſurely if he himſelf once judged it a leſs merciful and benign Oeconomy to uſe his Prerogative of Abſolute Dominion in viſiting the ſins of the Fathers upon the Children though otherwiſe culpable, and therefore confirmed it with an Oath, that As he lived, there ſhould be no more cauſe of uſing that Proverb in Iſrael, <hi>The Fathers have eaten ſower Grapes, and the Childrens teeth are ſet on edge;</hi> he will not in theſe laſt dayes, wherein you tell us, he hath clearly explicated and unfolded his Everbleſſed Nature, ſo farr derogate from his illuſtrious Goodneſs, as to become more harſh and ſevere, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Innocency it ſelf feel the heavy weight of an implacable vengeance. Was he once ſo gracious as to accept of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for ſin, and pardon iniquities upon the Oblation of an Expiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and will he now have no mercy and compaſſion upon the blameleſs works of his own hands, who never offended unleſs it were in acting according to thoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples his own good hands placed in them? The firſt man was not turned out of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, and condemned to manure the Earth, till he rebelled againſt his Maker,
<pb facs="tcp:42065:11"/> and taſted of the tree of Knowledge: but according to your Doctrine, the ſouls of men are no ſooner created, but immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thrown out of thoſe armes which then embraced them, into a ſtate of bitterneſs and ſorrow, a region of malediction which both God and man abhorr. In a word therefore, if the long-expected Meſſias have propagated this Doctrine in the World, I dare not be ſo treacherous to God and Reaſon as to entertain what in my apprehenſion they both plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having ſeen the juſt exceptions of the Jew againſt Chriſtianity, occaſioned by that precarious Aſſertion of Irreſpective Decrees, which to every diſcerning eye appears a mighty impediment and hinderance to the planting in them a true value and eſteem of the Doctrine of the Holy Jeſus, We may in the next place attend a while to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, who though he be deprived of thoſe clear Declarations of the Nature and Mind of God, which Chriſtians do plentifully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; yet having the principles of good and evil, juſt and unjuſt, diſplayed upon his Nature by the bountiful maker of all things, and Truth being alwayes like it ſelf in how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever various ſubjects it may reſide, thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaks

               <q>When I look into the outward Fabrick of the corporeal world, and revolve the exact Order, Symmetry and Beauty of the external Creation, how every thing acts regularly within it's own Sphear, and all conſpire to the mutual good and perfection of the whole, I cannot but acknowledg the exiſtence of an Eternal mind, from whoſe pregnant fecundity this great ball of the Earth, the blew Ethereal skie, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever lies hid and undecerned within the vaſt capacities of immenſe ſpace, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their being and ſubſiſtence.

<pb facs="tcp:42065:12"/> perſon imagine, That God ſhould become a Tyrant to his creatures? That he ſhould have no compaſſion toward the works of his own hands? Nay further, That he ſhould introduce them upon the ſtage of being on purpoſe to reproach and make them miſerable; that let them do what they can in order to their future Bleſſedneſs, they ſhould be befriended of none, nor ever pitied by the tender bowels of that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Goodneſs which firſt brought them forth, but lie as unfortunate marks againſt which the arrows of Divine vengeance are perpetually levell'd, and their cries no more regarded by the Father of Spirits, then the groans of dying Victims by thoſe inſolent and unpitiful Deities to whom they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd; and which yet caſts a greater ſtain and blot upon the Oeconomy of your God, that he might not ſeem to condemn the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, but to act under the ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of Juſtice, you make him firſt deſign, then plot and contrive their ruine; which to effect, that he might ſet the better face upon it, he enacts a Law, entailing a ſure and ſevere puniſhment upon the breach of it, and in the mean time not only not affords thoſe whom he intends to deſtroy, the leaſt ſtrength imaginable to perform it: but on the contrary, by an overruling and
<pb facs="tcp:42065:13"/> uncontroulable power (which ſome of your Authors magnifie as the faireſt gemme in his beautiful Crown of Glory) neceſſitates them to have a vile commerce and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with Sin and Hell, that the beams and rayes of his Juſtice may ſhine with the more dazeling Luſtre in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and deſtruction: but as for thoſe whom his diſcriminative love ſelected to the participation of his own pacate felicity and beatitude, the ſame unlimited power moſt effectually carries them on through all ſtates and conditions, winking at their moſt enormous and hainous lapſes, perhaps into Adultery and Murder, or other courſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, and never forſakes them till they they are brought to the quiet poſſeſſion of what was theirs by an unchangeable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree before the World began. How deeply will the whole Creation of Rational beings reſent ſuch an act as this? and what ſmall reaſon can any man have to caſt his care, and erect a foundation of his hope up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that God who notwithſtanding the greateſt expreſſions of love and kindneſs to them, the moſt pathetical invitations of them to accept the gracious overtures of his Goodneſs, the higheſt ſenſe of averſion to their miſery, accompanied with Oaths and Proteſtations againſt it, and the faireſt

For conſidering the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy and Apoſtacy of mankind from their true Happineſs, and with what exorbitant and unlimited deſires and paſſions they come into the World toward the things of this preſent life, and how hardly they are wrought of to the entertainment of what is truly good and holy, the propounding of intricate Myſteries to them, while their diſtinguiſhing ſenſe of good and evil is ſo monſtrouſly depraved and out of order, is but (to uſe our Saviours ſimilitude) to put new Wine into old Bottles, offenſive to the hearers, and corruptive of the Truth it ſelf: and we may with as great reaſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a Subſtantial and ſtately Edifice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any foundation, or full eared-Corn ſo ſoon as the bare Grain is caſt into the ground, as look for the perfect and compleat Image of Chriſt in him who does not yet underſtand the Principles and Rudiments of Religion.

Or, what proof can he bring that he is acted by that Almighty Spirit of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Righteouſneſs, and renewed into the blameleſs Image of the bleſſed Jeſus, who omits no opportunities of Injuſtice and Oppreſſion? Theſe things therefore which are the very ground-work and foundation of that Evangelical Building which Chriſt came to erect in the ſouls of men, ought with all dure care and diligence, and with great earneſtneſs and ſeriouſneſe to be preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon men by the Preachers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that the People may be convinced their Teachers are real and ſincere in the buſineſs, and that what they ſo inculcate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them is for the future and unſpeakable benefit of their immortal ſouls. And by the frequent uſe of theſe Monitory Cautions and Exhortations it is to be hoped that men will grow more holy, and practice with greater circumſpection the plain duties of Morality, by which means they will be more apt to conceive and judge of the other more Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Doctrines and Articles of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which ought to be let alone till their proper-time come, wherein they may with ſome advantage be propounded to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, they being by the conſtant exerciſe of the Precepts of Juſtice, Equity and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb facs="tcp:42065:16"/> prepared and competently well fitted for the reception of the Myſterious and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condite part of Religion. It cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but be acknowledged a piece of great inadvertency and opinionative Curioſity in the generality of Preachers in theſe late times, to make it their buſineſs, in the firſt place, to inſtruct their Hearers in the moſt difficult, and many times diſputable points of the Chriſtian Religion, and fill their heads with unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table opinions, while they neglected the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the more ſerious and weighty matters of Juſtice, Mercy and Compaſſion. From hence came it, that in their Catechiſms and Confeſſions of Faith, they crowded ſo many unneceſſary and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Doctrines under the name and notion of Indubitable Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, and which were neceſſary to be believed in order to Salvation; ſuch as are the Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning Gods Decree of Election and Reprobation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And here I cannot but with all due regard and honour, commend the great Prudence of the Compilers, as of the whole Liturgie and Service, ſo particularly of the Catechiſme of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for the Inſtructing of the younger ſort in the Rudiments and Principles of Chriſtianity, wherein as there is nothing propounded as indiſpenſably neceſſary to be believed, but
<pb facs="tcp:42065:16"/> what is undoubtedly ſo; in like manner they modeſtly contented themſelves in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting only ſuch things as were by all the reformed part of Chriſtendome looked upon as unqueſtionably true, and the contrary condemned as falſe and adulterate: ſo that I may ſay of it as <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Goliahs</hi> Sword, <hi>There is none like it.</hi>

            <p>Thus (Reader) I have given thee a full Account and Reaſon of the following Diſcourſe, and of the Neceſſity of ſome ſuch way and method of Inſtructing the People as I have here deſcribed; which certainly is not to fill their brains with puffie Opinions, and jejune Diſputations: but a zealous cautioning them againſt all Vice and Immorality whatever, and a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exhorting them to the practice of Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Juſtice and Equity, Obedience to their Lawful Prince, and to all inferior Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, to do good and communicate to the Neceſſities of the Indigent and Calamitous; and when the caſe requires a further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in the Myſteries of Religion, ſuch a full and eaſie Explication of the ſeveral Articles and Doctrines contained in it, as may beſt ſuit with their Capacities and the plain Texts of Holy Scripture, which as

For if we look into the whole Hiſtory of the Goſpel, we ſhall find, that our bleſſed Lord was of as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and paſſive a conſtitution as ever the world had any cognizance of; and in this very inſtance, which was Chriſts laſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn viſit for the recovery of thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Jews, he hath left upon record to all ſucceeding ages of the World, the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency of his Love, and the greatneſs of their Obſtinacy and Rebellion: He rode in triumph, the children ſang <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to him, and he cured many impotent and diſeaſed perſons, that at leaſt that mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and wonder-working Power reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in him might extort this confeſſion from them, that he was the Son of God and the promiſed Meſſiah; and after all this, he weeps for their Infidelity and pities them with tears, and having his heart
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42065:23"/> and ſpirit full of love that is ſtronger then death, he leaves no way untryed: but ſpends the whole day amongſt them, and looks round about him towards evening, to ſee if any would invite him home, being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to depart, till their Ingratitude forces him away. And now that he is exalted in Glory, and ſits at the right hand of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inveſted with Majeſty and Power, his Compaſſions are no whit abated, nor is that benign care and Providence, which in the dayes of his Humiliation and condeſcent he exerciſed over the fallen generations of Men at all leſſened by the augmentation of his Bleſſedneſs and Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: but dayly woes and beſeeches us by his Miniſters and Servants to enter upon terms of amity and friendſhip with God, who in him hath been pleaſed to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the World unto himſelf. Should we now caſt our eyes upon the whole frame and fabrick of the Goſpel, we ſhall find it to be the moſt effectual engine that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdome could contrive for the winding of the minds and ſpirits of men from their too eager purſuit of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and gratifications of the lower life, and working them up to thoſe noble and high purpoſes for which they were made. And doubtleſs there is no man in whom
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42065:24"/> prejudice doth not outbalance reaſon, but will readily ſet his ſeal to this truth, there appearing in the Goſpel ſuch ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcentions to our capacities and comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances with the frailty of our condition, ſuch infinite averſneſs to our miſery and deſtruction, and ſuch powerful endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and attractives to Holineſs and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, that he cannot judge it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from any other, then a principle of Infinite Goodneſs, Love and Wiſdome. I might here further tell you, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel being deſigned to be the Religion of men of all ſorts and conditions, of all ranks and qualities, and ſo adapted to our ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal powers, and in the main drift and ſcope of it ſo plain and eaſie even to the moſt illiterate capacities, Divine Wiſdom could not but highly approve of it, and by a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable benediction ſuffer it to have that Univerſal effect it pretends to; that is, the full and compleat renovation of all mankind that would not wilfully reject the counſel of God againſt themſelves, and the perfecting every one without exception or limitation that would faithfully and cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to his utmoſt powers adhere unto it.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42065:31"/> to Gods everbleſſed Nature to ſay, that his Will and Power are not arbitrarious and ungovernable; but regulated and ballaſted by a Supreme Goodneſs: we are not in this caſe to look for bare <hi>Will,</hi> which is in it ſelf a meer blind principle; but for ſomething more Soveraign, for Wiſdom and Counſel, and for ends worthy of that adorable Majeſty which not only brought into being, but perpetually intereſſes it ſelf in the affairs of the whole Creation.

And to this the inward ſenſe of every good man bears witneſs, whoſe felicity is multiplyed by ſeeing others as happy as himſelf: and if it be a perfection in our Natures to be propenſe to mercy and compaſſion, and to do all that good which lies in our powers, then ſurely if we take a proſpect of Gods infinite and complete Goodneſs from the benigne and harmleſs temper of a vertuous and good man, we muſt neceſſarily conclude,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42065:32"/> that he cannot make any of the Creation miſerable without conſideration of their own default. A good man looks not upon himſelf as ſome particular being divided from the reſt of the World; but as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the whole Creation, which in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to his Great Maker, he accounts a part of his care, and graſps every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of life within his boundleſs mind; and if it lay in his breaſt he would inveſt them with all that happineſs God made them for. And beſide, what every boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and benigne man experiences in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, we have ſome inſtances of this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Charity left upon record. What paſſionate eruptions of ſpirit do we find in the holy men of old? <hi>Blot me out of thy book,</hi> ſayes <hi>Moſes;</hi> and, <hi>I could wiſh my ſelf accurſed from Chriſt, for my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Kinſmen according to the fleſh,</hi> ſayes St. <hi>Paul:</hi> Yea further, I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that if it were poſſible for a good man to be ſlain a thouſand times; yet ſo often as he revived, he would ſtill forgive the hand that ſtruck him: and which is yet more, he could be content (if it might ſtand with the goodneſs of God) to lie in Hell to all Eternity, ſo that he might be without ſin, rather then that any of the ſons of men ſhould be forever excluded
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42065:33"/> and debarr'd from the love and favour of God. And now do but compare this Noble and Heroical Spirit, with that inexhauſted fountain of Goodneſs which is concentred in the Eſſence of the Deity; and we ſhall ſoon ſee, that God is ſo far from making any of his innocent Creatures miſerable; that, acting according to the eternal laws of his own Nature, he muſt neceſſarily conſult the good and welfare of them all. God is <hi>Eſſential Goodneſs,</hi> an immenſe Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of love, which knows no bounds nor limits: Man is only good by participation, and his greateſt perfection is but a deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ray from that ſpotleſs Orbe of light and glory.

                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:42065:35"/>
                  <p>And here, that I may keep my ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of ſober Theology, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine nothing inconſiſtent to thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Oracles whoſe Authority ought to be tenderly regarded: I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God making all things according to their reſpective Idea's, which eternally ſhone in his All comprehenſive Wiſdom, it became neceſſary that he ſhould bring into being ſuch lapſable Creatures as the ſouls of men; for there being a fair poſſibility of ſuch intermediate Eſſences as humane ſouls, which ſhould be ſomething below the Nature of Angels, and yet ſuperiour to Bruts; and the Divine Fecundity being ſuch as (to ſpeak with reverence) did neceſſarily conſtrain him to expand his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Plenitude in the production of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever included no incompoſibility of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, it is not to be imagined that his Nature ſhould be leſs fruitful then the conceptions and apprehenſions of men, who can diſtinctly and rationally place another <hi>Species</hi> of Beings, and fill up that empty <hi>Chaſme</hi> between thoſe two ſo vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtant degrees of life, Angels and Beaſts. And therefore if men had been made Impeccable, there would want ſuch an order of Creatures in the World, as might with thoſe glorious <hi>Morning-ſtarrs</hi>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:42065:35"/> actuate a body of an Ethereal and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly conſiſtency, and yet with Brute-Animals be furniſhed with a congruity to inform courſer matter, and appear upon the earth clothed with fleſh and blood.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God who is in himſelf a full and compleat Happineſs, did likewiſe grant to all the productions of life, a power of exerting thoſe faculties his bountiful hand beſtowed upon them, and ſo of enjoying themſelves in the free uſe and exerciſe of them, and like an indulgent Father per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them the pleaſures and gratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of every degree of life he had placed in them; ſo that it ſeems a Benefit or Sacred Donative collated on mankind, that they were not ſtated in an inamiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Happineſs. For though we ſhould ſay with ſome, that ſuch is the Nature and Fabrick of humane ſouls, that unleſs we engage Divine Power in a perpetual Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, they could not be conſtituted in an Illapſable condition; yet that All-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mind foreſaw, that the calamity which many of them were like to undergo by deſerting their primitive Happineſs, was not ſufficient to out-ballance the good which might accrue to themſelves and the reſt of the Creation in their production;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42065:36"/> for albeit they were made Lapſable, yet it was no wayes neceſſary that they ſhould actually recede from their bleſſed life, and it was only their careleſs and negligent uſe of Gods paternal bounty in taking to themſelves too great a liberty of enjoying the pleaſures reſulting from Corporeal life, which were allowed them in due meaſures and degrees, whereby the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion was too farr called off from a ſteady obſervance of the Commands and Laws of the Divine life, that turned <hi>Adam</hi> and the reſt of his Off-ſpring out of a Paradiſiacal felicity into a World of briers and thorns. But beſide this, God eternally beholding in himſelf the Idea's of ſuch mutable creatures, which being brought into Being, would afterwards ruine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, did as it were on ſet purpoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terweave many acerbities and incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities in the ſtructure of their beings, which might check and reſtrain their other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe exorbitant luſts, when they are ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them to an eaſie deſcent, and ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly remind them of that better ſtate they are <hi>apoſtatizing</hi> from. Laſtly, God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the lapſe and degeneracy of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſouls, and conſidering that it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what proceeded from that <hi>incompoſſibility</hi> he himſelf had wrought in their Eſſential
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42065:36"/> ſtructure, he determined to ſend down upon earth the Meſſias, whoſe pure and immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſoul never left the bright Manſions of Innocency with the reſt of his degenerate Brethren, to the intent that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to fallen men, the unfeigned deſire and will of God, to re-inſtate them in the poſſeſſion of their ancient glory; and in purſuance of this good intention of his, to aſſure them of the powerful conduct of his everbleſſed Spirit, which ſhould be in them a never-failing principle of life, both in this World, and the other. Thus we ſee, that notwithſtanding the infinite fulneſs of the Divine Goodneſs, abundantly ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad upon the whole Creation; yet was not God at all obliged to create man <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peccable.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1.

For he that thus judges of that ever-bleſſed Being, not only removes from him all imbecility and imperfection; but inveſts him in the moſt infinite manner with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the mind of Man doth rationally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to be an excellency and perfection.

                  <p>That the Attributes of God are arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and like looſe-hanging adjuncts to be put off and on at pleaſure, I think there is no man who knows what he ſayes, ſo blaſphemous as to affirm, but God is what he is by the neceſſity of his Nature; for he cannot be God, except he be immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in all his eſſential proprieties: which immutability of his is ſuch, that he can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ceaſe to be, nor act any otherwiſe then may be conſonant to the fundamental laws of his own Being. Wherefore God being the higheſt and moſt incomprehenſible life and activity, cannot fail through the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial fecundity and plenitude of his bleſſed Nature of communicating himſelf to all poſſible and capable ſubjects; for the more perfect and compleat any life is, the more diffuſive it is of it ſelf; and the reaſon why Creation is not competible to any Being below the Deity, ariſes not from any poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive will of God to the contrary, but from the impotency and imperfection of it's Eſſence. But God being no ſteril and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42065:52"/> principle, but every way full and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, is not only carried forth to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of things, but to the order and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of them in ſuch a way as may moſt correſpond and ſuit with their intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical natures. Whether therefore theſe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of God <hi>ad extra</hi> (as the Schoolmen phraſe it) be guided and ſteered by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite and arbitrary Will, or whether they have not ſome other primary foundation, from which it is impoſſible they ſhould at any time ſwerve, and in which they are all terminated, comes now to be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For to ſay, that they are all bounded in the Divine Eſſence, and ſwallowed up in that immenſe Abyſs, introduces ſuch a confuſion in the Divine Attributes that our minds can have no particular or diſtinct ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of this or the other mode, and beſide gives no ſatisfaction to a rational in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer, who would be apt to queſtion, Whether there were not a ſubordination in the Divine <hi>Idiomata?</hi> and, Whether they be all equally active and operative? and laſtly, Whether the Holy Scriptures do not univerſally magnifie and extol ſome one Attribute above the reſt? For the Solution of theſe Difficulties we muſt examine our own faculties, and conſider what we mean by that Idea and repreſentation we have
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42065:52"/> of the Divine Nature; and, what it is that principally confers to the formation of that notion and conception we entertain in our minds of God. That there is in us naturally an <hi>Idea</hi> of a Being abſolutely perfect, which we neither derived from ſenſe, nor framed by the power of Fancy and Imagination, but is indelibly wrought and engraven in our ſouls by a Divine principle, and of the ſenſe of which we can never totally rid our minds, however impiouſly diligent we may be in debauching our Spirits, and Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly racing the venerable Name of the Deity out of his Temple, I ſhall take for granted: But there are ſome perfections which do more ſignally appear in the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and which peculiarly conſtitute the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a God; ſuch as abſolute and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Goodneſs, which being ſo boundleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diffuſive and communicative of it ſelf, is neceſſarily attended with an infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to govern and direct, and Power to execute and bring into being, whatever this fertile wombe of Love ſhall travail with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Theſe are the conſtitutive Principles of a Deity, and all other proprieties are but thoſe three grand Attributes ſeverally va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and modified. Now that they are not all of equal worth and excellency, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we look upon them as ſo many
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42065:53"/> diſtinct qualities in created Beings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there appears ſuch pain diſſimilitude, that a man can ſcarce withhold himſelf from concluding, that they will likewiſe retain their differences when exalted into the Nature of God himſelf. Goodneſs is of an univerſal latitude and extent, and all other excellencies and perfections of humane Nature are indiſcriminately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated in it. For a good man is not only excited by the innate generoſity and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his mind to do that which is beſt, but ſummons his Wiſdom and Knowledg to project and contrive, and then uſes his utmoſt Power to bring it into act. Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the rule and meaſure of his actions, and Wiſdom and Power receive their worth and excellency from the degree of Goodneſs they partake of. Knowledg and Power are more particular and ſtrait, and more in a lower ſphear, and our actions receive no moral denomination from them, but as they participate more or leſs of Goodneſs. For a clearer illuſtration of the preſent <hi>Theme,</hi> we will ſuppoſe Power to have actual Exiſtence, and carryed out to the effecting of whatever lies within it's ſphear and comprehenſion, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and unlimited, to be utterly incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any hindrance or impediment in it's
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42065:53"/> operations, and it will amount to no more than a furious and Gygantick ſelf-will, wholly indeterminate to good or evil, and as indifferent to deſtroy and remand back again into <hi>non-entity</hi> what it hath made, (if we can without a contradiction attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to it the Power of Creation) as at firſt to make it, whoſe blind and impetuous ſelf-will, is the ſole rule of all it's exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant actions, which being no knowing principle they may oft prove as ridiculous as the vain attempt of thoſe mighty Gyants to ſcale heaven by throwing mountain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mountain. We ſee then, that Power alone though we imagine it to have actual Exiſtence, ſpeaks no more perfection than that great and mighty wind which rent the Mountains, and brake in pieces the Rocks, when God paſſed by before the Prophet <hi>Elijah:</hi> And as the Lord was not in the wind, ſo neither is he to be found in ſuch boiſterous effects whoſe productive cauſe is meer ſelfiſhneſs and inconſiderate Will. God works not after any ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable impulſes, nor are we to look for meer Will and Power in the Creation of things: but for Wiſdom and Counſel deriving from immenſe benignity and love, which never acts but for worthy and deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ends, and for the behoof of things
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42065:54"/> themſelves. This being therefore the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Power conſidered in it's diſtinct ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, let us add to it the principles of Wiſdom, and then it will ſuggeſt to us the <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Manichean</hi> God, whom they make the Author of all the evill in the World; For Wiſdom and Power diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd from the bleſſed fountain of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is nothing elſe but armed wickedneſs. There is no Being can communicate any thing to another which it ſelf is not inveſted withal; and if we ſuppoſe the Exiſtence of a Being of infinite Subtlety and Power, it is impoſſible it ſhould be the Author of any Good in the World, becauſe it is poſſeſt of nothing but an unlimited deſire of doing miſchief; and for this reaſon alone, Wiſdom and Power are no further good, or ſpeak perfection then they are in conjunction with Abſolute Goodneſs: and conſequently muſt depend upon it as the beams of light diſperſt through the air up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sun, or faculties and actions upon the principles from whence they flow. That Wiſdom which is devoid of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is nothing but a higher degree of craft, ſomething of the Nature of that cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and wilyneſs we may diſcover in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racious Beaſts and Birds when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and prey upon the more innocent
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42065:54"/> and harmleſs ſort of Animals; ſo that we plainly perceive, that Wiſdom and Power ſeparated from Goodneſs, offer no notion of perfection at all to our minds; and therefore there is ſomething in the Deity more amiable and lovely, and which as it ſpeaks perfection it ſelf, and is the moſt deſirable and excellent thing upon earth, ſo it is the ſpring of all other Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes in the Deity, which are no further morally good, than they are united with this prime and noble quality.

This great Truth the ever-bleſſed Son of God verified, when he left the glory and beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Heaven, and pitched his Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle amongſt men. For wherein conſiſted the flower and excellency of his Divine Perfections? Was it not in that Univerſal Love and Benignity he expreſſed to the whole World? and in that tenderneſs and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42065:55"/> compaſſion he ſhewed by going about do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, and caſting an healing influence upon the bodies and ſouls of Men? This ſurely was the brighteſt ray of Divinity that ever ſhone from God manifeſted in the fleſh; and to this, every holy mans experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence bears witneſs, who then finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf moſt peaceable and calm, and moſt conformable to the Divine Image and Pourtraicture, when he is doing the moſt good, and his love moſt enlarged and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive; which Love never aſcends more acceptably to Heaven, than when it overflowes all capable ſubjects here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and ſtrives to unite and draw them up to God their great Source and Parent. Wherefore by what hath been ſaid for the explication of this Propoſition, it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently appears, that Goodneſs is the inmoſt Centre of the Deity, and Wiſdom and Power ray forth from thence like the beams of light from their lucid Centre, <gap reason="foreign">

For infinite Power never acting but in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to directive Wiſdom; nor Wiſdom and Power exerting themſelves but in the way of, and according to the laws of Goodneſs, which being in it's own Nature ſo fruitful and communicative, that all other Modes and Attributes are tinctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with it, and lie in a laxe and diffuſe manner within the ſphear and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it's Energy, it muſt alſo obtain the firſt place of acting as of right belonging to it.

Now what is there the mind of man can poſſibly excogitate more expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of a Being of infinite Perfection, than <hi>Infinite Goodneſs, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power?</hi> which Perfections appearing not to us of equal worth and excellency, we are led by the plain laws and dictates off reaſon to aſcribe to that the firſt place of working, which includes the higheſt and largeſt Energy and Virtue. God therefore acting according to the eſſential meaſures of an Univerſal and Almighty Goodneſs, cannot be looked upon as ſuch an Arbitrary Being as the Objection preſuppoſes: Beſide, that it is highly improbable in the nature of the thing it ſelf, that there is any ſuch thing as infinite <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> that is, as I underſtand it, ſuch a Being whoſe opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42065:59"/> are ſteered and conducted by no other principle but <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> it is certain that we judging of things according to thoſe innate Notions we have of them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not frame any ſuch conception of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for although it be true, that God might have placed other Idea's in us (and had his Nature been as Arbitrary as ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, no queſtion but he would have done ſo) yet it being likewiſe evident, that he hath not ſtamped any ſuch Characteriſtical Notes of his <hi>Eſſence</hi> upon us, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we ſhould entertain any other Notion of him then what plainly and apparently ariſes from that natural Idea of himſelf he hath ſigned upon every individual perſon of Mankind. Thus although we ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that God might ſo have ordered things at the firſt Creation of Men, and ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered and diſpoſed our Faculties in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the objects both of the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real and Intellectual World, that our Idea's of them ſhould be quite contrary to what we now find and feel in our ſelves, <hi>e.g.</hi> That the Idea of Matter ſhould agree to Spirit, and that of Spirit to Matter; yet they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>de facto</hi> otherwiſe, we can aſſign no other difference then what is now in the things themſelves.</p>

It is altogether inconſiſtent with the Eternal and immutable <hi>Veracity</hi> of God to inveſt our ſouls with ſuch Notions and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions as were not truly ſignificative and expreſſive of his Nature. For this <hi>Eternal Mind</hi> intending the good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of all created Beings, endued them with Powers and Faculties agreable to their reſpective Idea's, and ſo contrived all things by an unerring Wiſdom, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould want it's part of that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and happineſs for which it was at firſt made.

                  <p>From theſe foregoing Conſiderations, we may by an eaſie and natural deduction inferr, that God never deſtinated any of mankind to Deſtruction; but that all the calamity and miſery they undergo, either in this World or the next, is the proper iſſue and product of their wilful Apoſtacy and defection from him.

For as the great <hi>Proplaſtes</hi> of the Univerſe beginning the efformation of a plant, and meeting with ſtubborn and inobſequious matter, gives it a different ſignature and impreſſion from it's natural Idea; and inſtead of adding to it it's due proportions and lineaments, deſpoils it of it's native forme and beauty by many miſ-ſhapen botches and protube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances: In like manner theſe direful and harſh apprehenſions of the Deity, meeting with a rough and unmalleable diſpoſition, inſtead of forming any conſiſtent notion, beget in it by their contagious affriction an utter averſation and malice againſt the thing it ſelf, and exaſperate it ſo far that it bends all it's ſtrength of wit and ſubtlety, to eradicate the very Being of a God out of the World. For undoubtedly if the minds of men be too untractable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Devotional and Religious, the next ſtep will be to take away all ſenſe and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of a Supreme <hi>Numen</hi> as being ſomething which otherwiſe would too much curbe and reſtrain them from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting that liberty their corrupt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched Natures aſſume to themſelves.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42065:67"/> And what is it that gives occaſion to ſuch diſmal thoughts, and renders the lovely <hi>Idea</hi> of God ſuch a <hi>Mormo</hi> and bugbear to men, that they endeavour by all poſſible wayes to extirpate it out of their minds; but only becauſe they ſee thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be the great lights of the Goſpel and Religion, and inſtructors of others in the wayes of Righteouſneſs, make ſuch dreadful repreſentations of his Nature, and ſet him forth in ſo frightful a dreſs, that they think the World had better be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, then groan under the Tyranny of ſuch a blood-thirſty Deity, who like churliſh <hi>Saturn,</hi> deſtroyes his off-ſpring ſo ſoon as brought into Being; nay before they were any thing but Idea's in the Divine Intellect, deſigned them by an irrevocable law to moſt ſharp and uneaſie torments? This certainly is the very inward ſenſe of the Atheiſt, who finding very contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and unaccountable explications as well of many other grand pieces of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as of the Nature of God, made by many who took themſelves to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the late times, wherein true Religion dwind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led away into nothing but formal perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, long and pompous Devotions, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and anxious Confeſſions, as well of the Articles of their Faith as Obliquities
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42065:67"/> of their lives, and pedantick niceties, took a fair occaſion to disbelieve all, and by a helliſh kind of policy, contrived at once a total everſion of Chriſtianity, by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the object of Religious Worſhip and expunging the notion of a Deity out of mens minds. What <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſomewhere ſpeakes of a barbarous ſort of people, the Atheiſt retorts upon thoſe rigid maſters of Theology, that it were much better to have no notion or conception of God at all <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, than to think that he takes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the blood of ſlain men, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts this the moſt perfect and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Sacrifice and Devotion. But this need not have driven the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> ſo far as to deny the Exiſtence of God; for had he looked into the inbred formes and chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of his own mind, and withal viewed the original draught of God in the Holy Scriptures, he might have taken a farr more true, lively, and amiable reſemblance of the Deity, than that which ſcared him from the very thoughts of his Being. God is one who carries on no ſelf-intereſt or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar deſign: but that which he moſt of all aimes at and intends ſhall take place upon Earth, is the propagation of his own Life
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42065:68"/> and Nature, and the general good and welfare of all the ſons of Men. Fond and unreaſonable Man indeed, when he hath gotten power into his hands, delights him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in making happy or miſerable at his pleaſure: but that ſteady and immutable <hi>Goodneſs</hi> which neither riſes nor ſets, nor admits any variation or ſhadow of turning, glories not ſo much in the diſplaying of his power and making himſelf formidable to the Creation, as in the expanſion and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latation of his Love, as the glory and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Sun are thoſe pleaſant rayes that flow from him. Gods power is nothing but Goodneſs arming and exerting it ſelf for the bringing about ſome deſign of Love; nor can he ever Will any thing but what is every way ſuitable and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to his invariable Goodneſs, which is the meaſure of his Will. And therefore to think that God takes any complacency in the ſole exerciſe of his Soveraignty and Dominion over his Creatures, or advances his glory by exalting and caſting them down, and making them the objects of his Love or Hare, according to his arbitrary Will and Power, is all one as if a Man ſhould ſeek for a name and glory by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about and treading upon a few poor Wormes. We all talke much of the glory
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42065:68"/> of God, but many of us have very ſhort and contracted conceptions, and too oft adopt our own fancies for genuine and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural apprehenſions of it, as if it conſiſted in the putting forth the acts of an unlimited Will and Power how and when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and declaring their effluxes and ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to be the rule of reaſon and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of all Moral Actions, and the grand Law of the whole Creation, or elſe in thoſe Hymns and Hallelujahs which are offered up to him by intellectual Beings from all quarters of the Univerſe: Whereas in truth his Glory is nothing without himſelf, nor any acquiſition and purchaſe to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his happineſs (for he being an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Plenitude of all Perfection, is incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving any complement of Glory or Bleſſedneſs) but then he moſt of all elevates and raiſes his glory and luſtre, when he moſt of all communicates his Nature, and ſhines in with a full and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted light of Truth and Goodneſs upon all the intellectual Creation. He never ſeeks his Glory in reſpect of us in any other way, than by diſpreading and imparting thoſe Soveraign Attributes of Love, Mercy, Patience, Wiſdom and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. And we in the moſt proper ſenſe do then advance the Glory of God higheſt,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42065:69"/> and diſcover it to the World in the moſt ample and tranſcendent manner, when the life of God becomes a Vital Principle in us, carrying us beyond the reach of corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real exſudations and defilements, which render the ſoul inept for a conformity to his bleſſed Image; and when Truth, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Righteouſneſs in which the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature is copyed out, become not empty and inſignificant Names and ſounds of words, but actuating and quickning Principles, and we ſtudiouſly endeavour to engrave thoſe beautiful Forms in our minds and ſpirits: In a word, then do we glorifie God, when we converſe with him in the Temple of an unſpotted heart, and derive from him in whom there is no ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh of iniquity, ſuch an Univerſal Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as lives within us, and pervades and ſanctifies all our actions: And this the Lord Chriſt who beſt knew how to glorifie God, hath intimated to us,<note place="margin">Joh. xv. 8.</note>

                  <p>I have now finiſhed this Argument from the conſideration of the Divine Nature, and have deduced ſuch genuine and legitimate Concluſions, that if rightly eſtimated and weighed, cannot but implant for the future in every unprejudic'd mind more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſerene Apprehenſions of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

For, whether is it better to ſay, That God by his Eternal Prerogative of Abſolute Dominion over all his Creatures, has adjudged the greateſt part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to inevitable miſery, for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but upon the impulſe of his own Will, and to ſhew the glory of his Power: Or to ſay, That God for the ſin of one Man (whom he made the Repreſentative of the ſucceeding Generations of Men to the end of the World) committed ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of years ago, and imputed only to his Poſterity, who were no more able to help it, than to hinder their being born into the World, ſhould take the advantage of his lapſe, and decree the greateſt number of Mankind to Everlaſting deſtruction. And if we impartially view this latter, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear no leſs precarious and abſurd than
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42065:70"/> the former. For though it be true, that we are really and formally guilty of Original Sin; yet to ſay, that God did phyſically predetermine <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall: or in the mildeſt ſenſe, That he looked upon man as fallen (for the <hi>Reprobationiſts</hi> are not conſiſtent with themſelves) and ſo took the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity which he foreſaw would offer it ſelf by his lapſe to bring about his deſign of ruining the greateſt number of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, is to bring Almighty God the Father of compaſſions upon the ſtage of the World, ſpeaking unto the calamitous Off-ſpring of <hi>Adam,</hi> like the Wolfe when he intended to devour a Lamb:

For although ſome would ſeem to excuſe this Oeconomy from all harſhneſs, iniquity and rigor by ſubſtituting the ſofter termes of Preterition or negative Reprobation; yet if they will unmask their apprehenſions and ſpeak plain ſenſe, the difference will appear only in words, not in the thing it ſelf, and is all one as if a man ſhould ſeek to alleviate the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity of a condemned Malefactor, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him he ſhould not die by Common but Noble hands; For the event declares Gods intention: and the denial of his help to extricate them from miſery, is equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to a poſitive Reprobation.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42065:75"/> aſſuredly conclude that all Mankind (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it comes to paſs) are extremely ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated and apoſtatiz'd from that innate purity and excellent ſtate in which they were created (for no Man that believes himſelf made by an Alwiſe and infinitely perfect Author, can imagine that he came thus lame and maimed out of his hands) and ſunk as low as the capacities of their Nature will permit, being only vivacious and active to trifling, low, and bodily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and concernments, carrying on ſuch poor and momentary deſigns as are unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the native generoſity of their minds; in a word, ſo devoid of that life in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of which conſiſts their true felicity, that they are paſt hopes of recovering by their own ſolitary endeavours their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine and ancient glory. But although Man by that venturous and bold revolt from the bleſſed Kingdom of Light, diſpoſſeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of Gods favour, and forfeited all right and title to his ordinary care and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; yet that ever-to-be-magnified Goodneſs which made him at firſt Lapſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, beheld him as a calamitous object of compaſſion, and deſigned the erecting and reedifying that glorious Temple which ſin and unrighteouſneſs had miſerably defaced and ruined, and the repoſſeſſing his own
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42065:75"/> life of it's rightful Government and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the Souls of Men, which however they come into the World the ſubjects of bruitiſh luſts and paſſions, are yet capable of Angelical accompliſhments, and a Vital Union with the Creator of all things: God therefore being the higheſt and moſt perfect life, and feeling and knowing his Nature to be the moſt pretious thing in all the World, and the utmoſt perfection of every Rational Being, could not but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend graciouſly to his lapſed Creatures, and ſeek the extenſion and diſpreading of his goodly Attributes over all capable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the World of life. For he that ſhall look upon the diligence and activity of the dark Powers in enlarging the bounds of their uſurped Kingdom, and conſider the contagious and diſſeminating Nature of every pitiful and degenerate luſt, how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very crazie and ſickly vice attempts and offers at a further explication of it ſelf, and every ſmall Exarchat of that Helliſh Principality endeavours dayly to make new additions, and take in freſh ſupplies to maintain the general cauſe of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and augment their petty Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, can never think that God will ſit as a diſintereſſed ſpectator; but promote and advance his own good life to the command
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42065:76"/> of the whole Creation, and brake down the power of that great <hi>Arimanus,</hi> who captivates the ſons of Men in the fetters and ſhackles of Mortality and Death. The life of God is a ſtrong and powerful principle, and hath alwayes the arme of Heaven to aid and aſſiſt it: but all ſin and unrighteouſneſs is a meer poverty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, not able to exiſt in the World, did not the ſelf-wills of men uphold it, and can never ſtand againſt the potent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of the Heavenly Nature. Which holy life that God might reeſtabliſh in the World, he hath delivered the Goſpel, the laſt and moſt perfect diſpenſation that ever was or ſhall be communicated to Men, which conſiſts not in an external and dead form of words, nor is it a meer ſyſteme and compendium of ſuch precepts, that like the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, ſanctifie only to the purifying of the fleſh, but cannot <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42065:76"/> to himſelf: but ſuch a Method of perfect Righteouſneſs and Virtue as ſhall purifie, refine and exalt the ſpirits of Men from all feculent concretions, and ſubdue every irregular motion and unruly deſire that would tempt and ſollicit their choice of corporeal joyes, and beget in them ſo true a reliſh of unblameable Goodneſs and Holineſs, as ſhould at the end of their mortal life inſtal them in the full poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of everlaſting Tranquility and Peace. Of which glorious contrivance, though we have a <hi>Scheme</hi> and <hi>Model</hi> drawn out in the Holy Goſpels; yet there is a life and ſpirit in Chriſtianity that cannot be blotted on paper, but lives and acts in ſuch hearts as are framed and ſquared according to thoſe Rules contained in the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.

It is true, when God at firſt made Man, and ſent him into this lower World, he left him to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by thoſe innate preſcriptions and rules of Righteouſneſs he interwove in the conſtitution of his Nature at his firſt production; and while he followed this light, and turned not aſide to the falſe fires of his depraved will, he walked in ſafe and ſecure paths: But when Men began to multiply upon earth, Sin and Vice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and the infectious ſteams of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſoon grew into a cloud and obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the light of the day, and men forſook
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42065:77"/> their ancient Guide, and wandred about in Darkneſs and Error; and the voice of Reaſon was not heard when Self-intereſt and Paſſion became the ſole principles of action. Hence it came to paſs, that in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of time Mens diſcriminative facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties growing inſenſate and dull through the life and vigour of their Animal powers, and their <hi>Criteria</hi> abating and looſing their quick and nimble taſt and relliſh of true good and happineſs, they chooſe only the preſent ſatisfaction and pleaſure of their corrupt Appetites, and embraced blindfold every inordinate motion and paſſion; and it was too late now to curb and reſtrain their lawleſs and rampant Deſires. For although Divine Goodneſs which was never abſent nor withdrawn from the World, did in all Ages and Places raiſe up conſiderable and holy Perſons to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the perverſe Sons of Men in the wayes of Righteouſneſs; yet their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Admonitions were entertained by very few, the reſt of the World ſtill ſlumbring in their old wickedneſs and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and chuſing ſuch faint and glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering flames to guide themſelves by, ſuch weak and ſickly Principles as might leaſt diſtrub their fancied Peace, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt their deſired Security. Wherefore
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42065:78"/> when this way proved unſerviceable and unfit for Mans Reſtauration, God entred upon a new Diſpenſation, and revealed himſelf more plainly to the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſelecting <hi>Jacob for his Portion, and Iſrael for the lot of his Inheritance,</hi> conducting them by an infant Religion which ſhould make way and prepare their minds for the reception of that glorious Myſterie which in due time ſhould be communicated to the World; and delivering to them Laws, Statutes and Judgments, fencing and hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the impure eruptions of their deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Natures by <hi>Judicial Decrees,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiedging Vice and Iniquity by the actual promulgation of a Law. But the main of this Oeconomy was only <hi>Thetical</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive,</hi> deriving it's obligation meerly from the Divine Command, and adapted for the moſt part to the <hi>Plaſtick</hi> Powers of the ſoul; for it conſiſting chiefly in external Performances which had no intrinſick Goodneſs contained in them, nor any other Reaſon of their injunction, but the will and pleaſure of the Impoſer, it could not aſcend higher then the Fancy or Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, nor contribute any thing to the ſublimating Reaſon and Intellect, while all it's motions were determined in ſo low a ſpear. And hence aroſe the great imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42065:78"/> of the <hi>Moſaical Law,</hi> in that it had only an <hi>Adumbration,</hi> and preſented a Landtschap of <hi>good</hi> things, and not the <hi>very image</hi> and <hi>ſubſtance,</hi>

As we have polluted our Natures by a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs regard and Adheſion to corporeal pleaſures, and ſunk our ſelves deep into the material World; ſo on the other ſide, our reverſion to our loſt happineſs muſt be effected by refining our ſouls from ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene dregs, and converſing with our mind and intellect, and ſubjugating our Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal powers to the dictates and <hi>Imperium</hi> of Reaſon.

And becauſe afflicted and perſecuted Vertue could not be thought eligible meerly for it ſelf, nor be a ſufficient argument to induce us to the love and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it who were ſo fatally addicted to the concerns of ſenſe; therefore God who knew our frame and how far, and to what degrees we had apoſtatiz'd from his holy Nature, did not only propound good things to our choice, but ſolicit our wills to the embracing of them by the ſtrongeſt evidences and moſt attractive motives that our Natures were capable of receiving. The life of ſenſe being more powerful and laying a greater, though not a juſter, claim to our minds as we are born into this World, God was pleaſed to deal with us after a ſenſible manner, and in a way of condeſcending Wiſdom, proportioning the Truths he delivered to us to our capacity of reception: And this was that the Apoſtle called the <hi>Fooliſhneſs of Preaching,</hi> wherein God ſtoops down and puts on the garb and frailties of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42065:84"/> and ſuits the reſults of his will with our mean and ſhallow apprehenſions. <hi>Great is the Myſterie of Godlineſs, God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the fleſh,</hi> and cradled in the circle of a Virgins arms: which clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, even to outward ſenſe, the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Goodneſs and Wiſdom of Almighty God, that he hath not caſt off the care of Mankind, but is at peace with the World, and hath put on the bright robes of Loving-kindneſs and Mercy, which he hath given a large <hi>Specimen</hi> and full proof of in the Miſſion of the Lord Chriſt from heaven. God would have all men lay aſide their hard thoughts and cauſleſs-jealouſies and ſuſpicions of his Nature, as if he did not from his heart intend them good, but only ſuſpended his anger for a time, which might again break out upon them in prodigious floods of vengeance and fury. For this is the moſt certain ſign that God wills and deſires our happineſs and welfare, in that he hath united himſelf to our Nature, and ſent down his only begotten Son for no other purpoſe, but to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt: <hi>And if he ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all; how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> What is there now can lay a greater tie upon ingenuous ſpirits, then

               <p>And that we may not think we are ſet to remove mountains, or perform impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities when we are exhorted by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to the participation of Gods holy life, we ſhall never be left alone to ſink under our load and die; but ſhall have the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42065:85"/> of that <hi>Almighty</hi> and <hi>Demiurgical</hi> ſpirit of Love, who hovered over the dark <hi>Chaos,</hi> and brought into Being the goodly frame of heaven and earth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed all the immenſe tracts of ſpace with ſutable inhabitants.<note place="margin">Wiſd. ch. vii.</note> This is that <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> which is the <hi>brightneſs of the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, the unſpotted mirrour of the power of God, and the Image of his Goodneſs; which remaining in her ſelf makes all things new, and in all ages entring into holy ſouls makes them friends of God and Prophets. She will not lodge in a ſinful body, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide when unrighteouſneſs cometh in; For ſhe is more beautiful then the Sun, and above all the order of ſtars, being compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the light, ſhe is found before it.</hi> This kind and loving ſpirit will God beſtow upon every one that asks it of him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair his broken and decayed Nature; to raiſe up the Divine Image, to joynt and confirm every perverſe diſlocation in the frame of his ſoul, and to perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the living efformation of Chriſt within him. Let no man then deſpair of attaining to a ſtate of Bleſſedneſs under the Goſpel; for this Benign Spirit, whoſe delights are with the Sons of Men, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the whole World, and touches and overſhadows every man with out-ſtretched
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42065:85"/> wings, who is willing to have the Divine Image and Pourtraiture formed in him, and doth not by impurity and uncleanneſs chaſe it away. Though our enemies are mighty, and our ſouls weak; yet let none deſpair of Victory; for through the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and conduct of that Almighty, we ſhall be able to overcome them. He is ever cheriſhing and foſtring the life of God wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it's born into any ſoul, and ſweetly inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates into our minds, and hallows and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies all our powers, and excites us to a ſerious and hearty purſuit after the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable laws of Truth, Righteouſneſs and Goodneſs. We are not fallen and degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beyond the power of God, but his Spirit is able to raiſe and bring up our ſouls from the loweſt Hell, and to renew and reform our debaſed and wretched Natures. For what cannot he do, who at firſt made us faultleſs and happy, till we ruined and defaced his bleſſed Image, and rendred our ſelves the miſerable objects of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions? What is there in our frame ſo ſtubborn and inſequacious that he cannot rectifie and redreſs, who at firſt created all things, and brought into Being all the Beauty and Harmony of Heaven and Earth? He will never leave us deſtitute and forlorn, but will take hold of every
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42065:86"/> fitneſs and capacity till he have perfected in us the Divine life and brought us unto Glory.</p>
               <p>But becauſe Examples are more preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent with mankind then Precepts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions; that God might not leave any thing undone which would in any kind conduce to our Intereſt, he hath recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us the Example of his Bleſſed <hi>Son,</hi> as the faireſt copy of Holineſs, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Compaſſion and Self-reſignation, that ever was yet diſcovered to the World. For ſhould we compare him with the greateſt lights that ever ſhone upon the <hi>Gentile</hi> parts of the Earth, they would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as foils and ſhadows to ſet off his glorious luſtre and Divine ſplendor, as hath already been made good by a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and profoundly Learned Perſon. There is none can hold any equality with the Lord Chriſt; not <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, the Divine Lawgiver of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who indeed was <hi>faithful in all his houſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. ch. iii.</note> 
                  <hi>as a Servant, for a teſtimony of thoſe things which were to be ſpoken after: But Chriſt is a Son over his own houſe, being the Heir of all things, and therefore is counted worthy of more glory than Moſes.</hi> And though we read, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was <hi>meek, above all that dwelt upon the Earth;</hi> yet when he was to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42065:86"/> fetch water out of the Rock for the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> his ſpirit was ſo farr provoked, that <hi>he ſpake unadviſely with his lips;</hi> and after forty years troubles and vexations in the Wilderneſs, he brought not his people into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but dyed after he had taken a proſpect of the Promiſed Inheritance, which he muſt not <hi>go to poſſeſs.</hi> But on the contrary, the Lord Chriſt whoſe lips were full of Grace and Truth, and in whoſe mouth never was any guile found, not only promiſed a ſpiritual <hi>Canaan,</hi> a Land of immortal peace and reſt, but went alſo himſelf and took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it, and ſignified the ſame to the world by ſending down his holy Spirit upon his Church. All the time that he dwelt upon Earth and converſed with Men, he was full of the Spirit of Love, Tenderheartedneſs and Compaſſion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually going about doing good, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the broken-hearted, gathering the Lambs in his arm, and carrying them in his boſom, and gently leading thoſe that are with young, healing all their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, curing their diſeaſes, and eaſing them of their painful ſorrows. He that was purer then the Sun, and whiter then the Robes of Angels, yet was content to veil his Glory, and put on the dark and courſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42065:87"/> mantle of our fleſh and blood, that he might teach us humility and ſubmiſſion to the will of God. He whoſe the Earth was, and the fulneſs thereof, would not be born in a Princes Court among the Sons of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; but in a Stable, at a ſmall Town, and among the meaneſt of his Creatures, that he might abate our Pride and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur in oſtentation of our ſelves to the World. His life, though a perpetual Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, encompaſſed with hardſhips and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and drawn out into many Scenes of trouble and ſorrow; yet was alwayes holy and harmleſs, and never ſtained with the leaſt ſin or unwarrantable action. His Soul was a pure and ſpotleſs Temple, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally conſecrated to the Divinity reſiding in him: His Heart the holy Altar upon which no unchaſt flames ever burnt, but the fire of Zeal and Love which was kindled from Heaven, and dayly ſent up clouds of Incenſe as a ſweet ſmelling ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour thither again: His Meekneſs and Patience were no leſs conſpicuous, than thoſe other radiant vertues which rendred him acceptable to God and Man; for <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reviled, he reviled not again; when he ſuffered, he threatned not;</hi> but committed his cauſe to him that judgeth righteouſly, and thereby he became glorious in the eyes
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42065:87"/> of God, who recompenced his Indignities, by giving him <hi>a Name above every Name.</hi> If we look at his outward condition, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came poor and needy for our ſakes, that <hi>we through his poverty might be made rich;</hi> for though we read that <hi>Judas</hi> bare the bag, yet his holy Lord and Maſter was forced, by the expence of a Miracle, to pay his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute peny to the <hi>Roman</hi> Governor. The Foxes had holes, and the Birds of the air neſts, but the Son of Man had oft no where to lay his Sacred Head, but on a pillow of graſs, and his covering was the bright and ſpangled Canopy of Heaven; and yet we never find him murmuring or diſobliging Heavens Care and Providence by a repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſpirit: thereby teaching us, that our happineſs lies not in the abundance of earthly Goods, but in the Godlike temper and frame of our minds, and <hi>that having food and rayment we ought therewith to be content.</hi> When he was entring into the ſhadow of Death, and beginning his bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Paſſion, with what manly courage did he behave himſelf? and, How illuſtrious did he appear in a patient and magnanimous ſuffering all thoſe Ignominies and Diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that were put upon him, beholding through the cloud or ſhame and reproach, the good effects of the travel of his ſoul,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42065:88"/> and confidently believing, that though he ſate in Darkneſs for a while, yet his Light ſhould break forth from obſcurity more glorious then the Sun when he <hi>rejoyces as a ſtrong man to run his race.</hi> And when his Humanity began to ſink, and that which was Natural in him cryed for eaſe and relief from the heavy preſſures of that doleful Agony, ſo that he deſired <hi>if it were poſſible that that cup might paſs from him;</hi> yet through the life and vigour of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit by which he was acted, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns over his whole will and deſires to the wiſe diſpoſal and pleaſure of his Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done:</hi> Hereby giving us a Sacred Method and Rule whereby to demean our ſelves, when the Divine Providence brings us into Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities and Afflictions; namely, to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Holy Jeſus and follow his ſteps. Let us now accompany him to his painful bed of ſorrows the Croſs, where his friends forſake him and ſtand aloof of, and his enemies compaſs him round, where his holy ears that uſed to hear the melodious accents of Angels, are grated with the prophane obloquies of diſobedient ſinners; and his eyes which beheld the glories of Heaven, and the beauty and luſtre of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, are now forced to ſee the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42065:88"/> of his miſery and ſorrow; yet when his Crucifiers meant him the moſt evil, he breaths forth from a heart which never knew what it was to hate, this paſſionate Prayer for them, <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi> This alſo was written for our inſtruction, that we might <hi>love our enemies, bleſs thoſe that hate us, and pray for them who deſpightfully uſe us, and perſecute us;</hi> and by ſo doing, become <hi>the children of our Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who maketh his Sun to riſe on the evil and on the good, and ſendeth rain on the juſt and on the unjuſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But all this would yet have proved weak and ineffectual for the promoting the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine life in the World, if Chriſt had not viſibly aſcended into heaven, and given us a ſenſible aſſurance of a bleſſed ſtate in the immortal Regions above, that he will take up Humane Nature after due purifications and refinements into a participation of that tranſcendent felicity he is fully poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of. For if men had been left in ſuſpence and uncertainties, it would caſt a fatal damp upon their attempts and endeavours after righteouſneſs; but being fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced as well of the Exiſtence, as that God will take care of their ſouls when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part this obſcure and evanid life, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42065:89"/> their labour and trouble here with ſuch great degrees of Happineſs as ſhall farr ſurpaſs the higheſt calamity they can ſuffer in this World, it cannot but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirit their minds with life and reſolution to break through all difficulties and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, and with a manly valour fight the good fight of Faith, and never give over till they lay hold on Immortality, and God Crown them as Victorious Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors with wreaths of immarceſcible Glory. It is but a groundleſs fancy in ſome to think, that the intuition of the reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to us, in order to our further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in Holineſs and Virtue, is acting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mercenary principles, ſince that Chriſt himſelf in his greateſt Agonies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts ſupported the weakneſs of his Nature with the conſideration of the reward he ſhould receive as the compenſation of his humiliation and ſorrows; for ſo we read, <hi>That he endured the Croſs,</hi>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42065:89"/> in this life. Grace and Holineſs is but Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs wrapped up and cloſed, and Glory is nothing but Holineſs explicated and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded to it's due latitude and dimenſions. Piety is Heaven masked with a cloud of fleſh, and begirt with ſorrow; and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is Virtue ſhining in it's native bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and clothed with a Celeſtial ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. And that Ethereal and Paradiſiacal body, with which all believers ſhall be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed through the gracious bounty of the Lord Jeſus at the Reſurrection of the Juſt, is the neceſſary appendage of our felicity, and by it's eaſie and obſequious motions will raiſe in the exalted powers of the ſoul, the higheſt ſenſe of love and joy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful enraviſhments of ſpirit. He then that loves Virtue for it's appendant reward, does in effect love it for it ſelf, and is no whit behind him that is attracted by the naked pleaſure reſulting from it, and thinks it eligible amidſt the hoarſe bellowings of <hi>Phalaris</hi> his Bull, becauſe the Reward hath a very great affinity and cognation with Virtue, and is no otherwiſe attainable then by a full and perfect exerciſe of it. This great happineſs therefore accruing to the ſoul of Man when refined and purified from the dregs of Earth and Mortality, is very rationally ſet forth in the Goſpel
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42065:90"/> to invigorate the minds of men, and raiſe them to the free exertions of the Divine life, and to animate their dying reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons when they walk through a troubleſome wilderneſs, and are called to reſiſt even unto blood. And if it were not for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of future Bleſſedneſs, all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would fall to the ground, (the inward ſenſe and feeling of the ſoul being ſo much weakned and debilitated by her continual imbibition and attraction of the dregs of the Earthly and mortal Nature, whereby ſhe is become ſluggiſh and inactive, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, her paſſions and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions being in a manner wholly corporeal) and Truth and Virtue be but idle names or dreams of a ſhadow, exiſting only in the tongues and fancies of Men, but never deſcending into the depth of the ſoul, and impregnating it with their living Image.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the grand Inſtruments which the Spirit of God makes uſe of in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to induce and perſwade the World to act under the Government of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine life; which if skilfully applyed and managed, will undoubtedly compleat and perfect that bleſſed work which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence intended them for. For we cannot think that Heaven would alarm the World
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42065:90"/> with a falſe report, or raiſe the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men by a great ſound and noiſe of ſomething extraordinary, when in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion it amounts but to ſome inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and trifling deſign. The Eternal Son of God, who was that Wiſdom which is the delight of Heaven, and rejoyced in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable parts of the Earth, brought down with him from the ſeat of Majeſty, that Sacred and recondit method of recovering lapſed mankind, which was carryed in the pregnant womb of Goodneſs from the dayes of Eternity, and he became our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and pervades the very Centre of our Being, and ſhapes and frams his Image of Wiſdome and Righteouſnes there, ſtrengthning our decayes, and ſupporting our weakneſs, and conſuming and expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all our droſs and corruption by a ſubtle and powerful Energy, which in Scripture phraſe is, to be <hi>Baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire.</hi> We are fallen into a narrow and contracted ſtate, and thoſe Divine forms in our union and fruition of which conſiſted our bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are quite defaced by our fond long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after, and adheſion to, corporeal fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Now God manifeſting himſelf in our fleſh, renews and perfects thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Images again, and ſtamps his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42065:91"/> upon us; and, as the great conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating Principle of the corporeal World, figures and ſhapes out of prepared mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the body of a plant; ſo the Holy Spirit frames and ſhapes out the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature in the lapſed World of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>But this great purpoſe of the Goſpel, this great deſign and plot which God hath laid to reduce Mankind to that bleſſed ſtate from whence they fell, is wholly fruſtrated and evacuated by the Doctrine of <hi>Irreſpective Decrees.</hi> And that I may not charge it with what it ſtands not guilty of, I ſhall make it good by theſe two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It renders ineffectual the purpoſe of God in the Goſpel, by lulling Men aſleep in the lap of Security and Preſumption of their good eſtate, upon the groundleſs fancy of their Abſolute Election from all Eternity. For Men being once initiated and inſtructed in the Myſterie of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Doctrine, will with much anxiety and vehemency of mind, contend for the truth of that which they ſo paſſionately deſire to be ſo, and having withal ſo amorouſly courted and eſpouſed their luſts and unruly paſsions, and yet being terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and affrighted with the laſhes of their
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42065:91"/> own Conſciences, they will with great eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and zeal take ſanctuary in ſo pleaſing an opinion which both gives them a fair countenance to enjoy and reap the pleaſure of their ſenſual paſſions, and ſecures them from thoſe domeſtick furies which perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually hurried and tormented them, and over and above ſooths them up with a confidence of eternal bliſs and felicity. And he that can attain to this <hi>Plerophory</hi> or full perſwaſion of his Election from before the foundation of the World, hath the <hi>White Stone</hi> given to him (though he be ſo farr from eating of the hidden <hi>Manna,</hi> that he feeds upon nothing but husks and vanities) and his name is enrolled among the Stars, and he is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, out of the reach of danger, and if <hi>he fall, he ſhall not be utterly caſt down, for God will raiſe him up:</hi> The gates of hell ſhall never pluck him out of Gods hands, nor ſeparate him from his eternal Love; <hi>for having loved his own, he loveth them unto the end.</hi> The thickeſt cloud of ſin and darkneſs ariſing from his polluted and rotten heart, though it may ſuſpend for a while, yet can never totally diveſt him of Gods paternal Love and favour, becauſe he is one of Chriſt's Sheep, of his little flock, and he <hi>knows him,</hi> and is confident he is known of him: and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42065:92"/> though he have lived in vice, and rolled in the dirt and mire of the Earth till the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Period of his life; yet the holy Spirit will infallibly and irreſiſtibly at the very <hi>Exit</hi> of his ſoul, change and renew it, and caſt the robes of Chriſt's ſpotleſs Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs upon it, and then 'tis impoſſible the man ſhould miſs of heaven.</p>
               <p>And is this a Doctrine adapted to the carrying on the deſign God intended in the Goſpel, namely, the Reduction of the world to a conformity to the Divine will, to forſake and abandon all their ſinful and falſe wayes, and to live in a univerſal ſubmiſſion and reſignation to his holy Laws and Commands? What proof or evidence doth it bring that it aims at any ſuch thing? Is it in that it declares to a man that Faith and Repentance and every good motion of the ſoul is the irreſiſtible work of God, and that 'tis no more in his Power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any thing to his being a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, a juſt and Righteous perſon, than to add one cubit to his bodily ſtature: but if he be not as yet regenerated, he muſt ſtay and wait till that good time come, wherein the Spirit of the Lord ſhall enter into him, and make him a New Creature, <hi>for the wind bloweth where it liſteth?</hi> Or is it in that it affirms, That Chriſt dyed for the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42065:92"/> Elect, and (though the value of his Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction were infinite, and ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the whole World) for them only, and that his death hath ſatisfied for all their ſins, and that now God imputes the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Lord Chriſt to them, and upon his account they are eſteemed as righteous as if in their own Perſons they had fulfilled the whole Evangelical Law, though in the mean time their hearts are very corrupt and unſound? Are theſe the Demonſtrations by which this Doctrine of <hi>Irreſpective Decrees</hi> manifeſts it ſelf to come from God? If it bear the Superſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Image of God upon it, it is then as he himſelf is, <hi>Light,</hi> and there is no Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, no mixture of impurity and humane imagination in it; for God cannot patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize any thing but what is holy as he is holy, and pure as he is pure. But if we conſider well, ſuch Poſitions will appear very obſcure and frightful, horrid and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, ſavouring of the Prince of Darkneſs by whom they were breathed into the minds and ſpirits of unſanctified Perſons, and by them communicated to the World as the <hi>Arcana</hi> of Chriſtianity, but tending in reality to the everſion of it, and the augmentation and increaſe of the Devils Kingdom. For when Men ſhall hear, that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42065:93"/> upon ſuch and ſuch Pulpit-ſigns which their Impertinent Preachers deliver to them, they may gather their Election from all Eternity, and that maugre all the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Men and Devils, they ſhall never fall quite away by a final Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but aſſuredly recovered by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controllable and peremtory power: when they ſhall be told likewiſe, That Gods calls are at certain times and ſeaſons, and that till they perceive themſelves forcibly inacted and carryed away by the impulſe of the Divine Spirit, all their previous actions are to no purpoſe; Will not theſe things cauſe them to ſit down in lazineſs and take their eaſe, without troubling themſelves with the renovation of their minds, ſith that God will take care for that, and ſoak themſelves in terreſtrial joyes and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, till the dead-awakening trump (which when it will be they know not) call them from the Grave of ſin and death, as Chriſt did <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and bid them come forth? Will not the imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, and the mantle of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, damp the endeavours of men after real and inward Righteouſneſs and inherent Holineſs, by which they attain to a participation of the Divine Nature, ſince they can have anothers at ſo cheap a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42065:93"/> rate, which will likewiſe be as beneficial and ſtand them in as much ſtead as if they had of their own? Men are prone to pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate their ſin, and take hold of any pretence to ſtop the mouth of their accuſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and need no ſuch artifices to lead them into thoſe paths that go down to Hell, and the comfortleſs chambers of death. Their evil Natures and the examples of others, and temptations of Satan are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to draw them into Vice and Irreligion, that none need diſſeminate ſuch doctrins as ſhall invite them to immorality and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the Authority and Countenance of Gods word.

                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:42065:94"/>2. The ſecond Inſtance wherein, the Doctrin of <hi>Irreſpective Decrees</hi> inverts and deſtroyes the end and purpoſe of God in the Goſpel is, by leading Men into deſperation. I do not mean, that they ſhould deſpair of mercy ſo long as they continue in their ſins (for this every Criminal ought to do that he may be induced to come out of them the ſooner) but by Deſperation here, I mean, a disbelief of Gods will or power to ſave them, whereby they go on care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly and reſolutely in a courſe of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Iniquity. For being perſwaded on the one hand, that the number of the Elect is but ſmall in compariſon of Reprobates, and that both the one and the other are particularly deſigned and marked out by name, (for <hi>the Lord knows who are his</hi>) and that all the labours of men after the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven will prove unſucceſsful and abortive, till God by a high and mighty hand come upon them, and powerfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of the evil of their wayes, and aſtoniſh them with the weight and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their ſins, laying them low and bringing them down (as they phraſe it) to the gates of Hell, and ſhewing them the worm that never dies, and the fire which never ſhall be quenched, and then making bare his arme and demonſtrating
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42065:94"/> his Power by lifting them up from thence into the warm Sun-ſhine of his favour, where they ſhall remain as ſecure of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as if they were there already, till God pleaſe by death to tranſlate them unto glory: And being taught on the other hand that whoever finds not this mighty <hi>work of Grace</hi> within him, and feels not this great change wrought in his ſpirit, it is a certain ſign he is in the ſtate of Reprobation, and one of thoſe who were of <hi>old ordained to condemnation:</hi> Men, I ſay, being thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and miſguided by Pragmatick zeal, that ſets up it ſelf in the place of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and not knowing that ever they had any ſenſe or perception of thoſe foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned effects being wrought in them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently conclude, that there is nothing to be expected for them but a ſure and inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Damnation. They never heard the ſound of that breath of heaven which quickens dry bones, and makes them ſtand up and live; nor ever were acquainted with thoſe impetuous agitations and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions of ſpirit, whereby the New-birth is formed in them: they never took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any ſuch audible <hi>Voice behind them,</hi> ſaying unto them, <hi>this is the way, walk in it:</hi> Nor ever felt any ſuch black tempeſt of horror and trembling ſeazing on them,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42065:95"/> which preſently (the cloud being blown over) was turned into a ſerene gale of quietneſs and peace. Now it being thus with them, what other concluſion can they draw from ſuch Premiſes, but that they are the objects of Gods hatred, and are utterly excluded from all hope of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyneſs by a Decree unalterable as the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians?</hi> For God hath determined (ſay the Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oniſts) and purpoſed in himſelf (and he is not as Man that he ſhould lye, or the ſon of Man that he ſhould repent) that he will ſhew mercy to none but thoſe few whom he hath pre-ordained to Salvation for the illuſtration of the Glory of his free Grace. What ſhall I now comfort thoſe deſpairing and diſconſolate ſouls withal? Should I tell them, that God hates nothing that he hath made, that he is the Father of Spirits, and no Parent will tare out the tender bowels of his own dear off-ſpring; they will preſently reply, that though the number of <hi>ſouls be as the ſand of the Sea, a remnant only ſhall be ſaved; a little flock, a tenth, as the ſhaking of an Olive tree, two or three ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on the top of the uppermoſt bough, four or five in the outmoſt fruitful branches;</hi> and though it be true, that God is the Father
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42065:95"/> of Spirits; yet he is likewiſe the Supreme Lord of his Creation, and <hi>May he not do what he will with his own? hath not the potter power over the clay?</hi> and therefore they are certainly veſſels of diſhonour, and included in that great multitude which ſhall inherit bitterneſs and ſorrow. Should I declare to them, that God is merciful, and <hi>will have all men to be ſaved, and come to the knowledg of the truth,</hi> and to this end hath ſent down the Lord Chriſt from heaven to declare to mankind, that he is reconciled unto them, and thinks thoughts of Love and Goodneſs towards them, and that if they will repent and turn to him, he will blot out their tranſgreſſions and remember their ſins no more; that Jeſus Chriſt is become an Alſufficient ſacrifice for the ſins of the whole World, and hath taken away that anger and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpleaſure that was conceived againſt the Sons of Men, having taſted Death for every Man, and that now he invites all in the moſt condeſcending terms to come unto him, and hath promiſed that <hi>Whoſoever comes unto him, he will in no wiſe caſt out:</hi> And what return now ſhall I have to theſe perſwaſions? they will tell me that it's true, God is merciful, and would have <hi>All,</hi> that is, ſome of all ſorts and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42065:96"/> conditions of men to be <hi>Saved,</hi> and to this end Chriſt came down from heaven, and was made man, that he might gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the World of his Elect, and taſted Death for every one of them, and theſe he invites, and theſe ſhall come to him, but none elſe, <hi>for no man can come unto Chriſt, except the Father draw him;</hi> and we have no evidence, or but plauſible grounds, to think, that he either hath or will draw any of us: his Sheep only know his voice and follow him: but we have no proof whereby we can collect our ſelves to be of his fold. Wherefore all our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are fruitleſs and vain, and you can give us no ſolid and ſubſtantial comfort to uphold our weak and dying hopes that we are not in a ſtate of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

For that they are included here, I think none can queſtion that attends how general the terms are, and if the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance be caſt on either ſide, the advantage will accrue to Reprobates; for <hi>Chriſt came not to call the Righteous</hi> (thoſe who preſume themſelves to be Elected) <hi>but Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> (ſuch as the World judges Caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awayes) <hi>to repentance:</hi> and beſides, the Text plainly implyes the ſame; for who are more weary and heavy laden, than thoſe who are dayly burdened and know not where to reſt?

And if it be certain (as it cannot be denyed) that all men whatever are intereſſed and concern'd in theſe paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate invitations, it is likewiſe clear as the Noon-day Sun, that all may come and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the benefit deſigned in them. If it be otherwiſe, can it conſiſt with the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Juſtice, and Veracity of Almighty God thus to tantalize and deceive his help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Creatures in things of ſo great weight and moment?</p>
               <p>Wherefore to avoid the dint and ſtroke of this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> the Reprobationiſts have ſtill a reſerve, a <gap reason="foreign">

But they are deceived if they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine this will ſerve their turn, and ſtand when aſſailed by the ſhocks of ſeverer Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. I muſt confeſs it is a very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent piece of work to go about to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute every petty Nicety and Evaſion, which ſcant and ſtraitned ſpirits invent to patch up their ruined and decayed opinions; yet
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42065:97"/> becauſe it comes in my way, I ſhall take the pains to examine it, that men may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate themſelves from prejudice and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and ſee where their unwary credulity and innocent ſimplicity hath been betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Sacrilegious hands of unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perſons, who have (as much as in them lies) hindred the Progreſs of the Goſpel, ſtifled the life of God, and bedwarfed Men in their ſpiritual growth and ſtature, by making them ſtand at a ſtay, or rather go backward in Chriſtianity, through their adminiſtring to them ſuch vitious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome nutriment. But to reply to this frivolous Anſwer; I ſay then, the Goſpel which is confeſſedly offered to Reprobates, cannot be ſaid to leave them inexcuſable, and that upon theſe accounts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Reprobates</hi> may be left inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable for not embracing the Goſpel, 'tis neceſſary that God ſhould put them into a capacity of yielding and condeſcending to thoſe terms and propoſals he ſhall make to them. But God hath not dealt thus with the greateſt part of the World (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of Abſolute Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation) and therefore is ſo farr from taking from them all excuſe, that he hath left ſufficient arguments, whereby accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſtricteſt rules of Reaſon and

He that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits praiſe for doing well, it is upon this account, that he might have done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: but when God by a Phyſical ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of his Power determines the ſoul to act thus, and leaves it not any power
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:42065:110"/> or ability of reſiſting, all the praiſe of that action muſt be due to God himſelf, not to Man who was but the inſtrument, and could not avoid it. <hi>Nemo peccat in eo quod vitare non poteſt,</hi> ſayes St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Neither can any action whatever be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a ſin in Man; becauſe he is not left a free agent, but acts fatally and unavoidably, and cannot be diſobedient to that ſuperior force that inacts his will: ſo that Murder, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Oppreſſion, contempt of Government, and whatever brutiſh action there is elſe, cannot come under the denomination of crimes, but he that commits them may juſtly plead that he could not avoid them, his will being never undetermin'd, and it was not poſſible that his weak ſoul ſhould hinder the ſtronger and more powerful bent and reſolution of heaven. How then can God in juſtice puniſh any man for doing that which he could not help? and, How can that be called a ſin, which is the effect of a neceſſary cauſe? The diſtinction between the act, and the pravity of the act the former of which God wills (ſay they) and works in us, but not the latter, will ſtand them in no ſtead; for in many actions the formality of ſin conſiſts in the very act it ſelf, as in Murder, Adultery, and ſuch like: Thus the eating of the forbidden fruit
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42065:111"/> was a ſin in it ſelf, and we cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between the act and the viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity; for the very act was forbidden, and the formality of the crime conſiſted not in <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Eve</hi>'s eating after any undue manner: but ſimply and barely in the very act of eating. And ſo in ſins of Omiſſion, this diſtinction like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe fails, nor will it free Almighty God from the imputation of being the Author of Iniquity and Vice. And it is no wonder to ſee this unworthy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine take ſuch deep footing in ſome mens minds, when they are ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſet and fixed upon it, that they will entertain any abſurdity, rather then free and unprejudice their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: Yea ſo hot was this Diſpute grown at <hi>Geneva,</hi> that <hi>Melanchton</hi> in an Epiſtle to <hi>Caſpar Peucerus</hi> amongſt other things relates this, <hi>Scribit ad me Lelius de Stoico fato uſque adeo litem Genevae moveri, ut quidam in carcerem conjectus ſit, propterea quod à Zenone differret.

               </p>
               <p>That which our Adverſaries collect from hence is, That there are ſome ordained and deſtin'd <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But the invalidity and abſurdity of this Explication will appear:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is a manifeſt contradiction to ſay, that the perſons here mentioned were Predeſtinated to Diſobedience; for in that it was deſtinated and decreed of God, it ceaſes to be diſobedience, and is properly an acting according to that immutable will and purpoſe of God, which is paſſed upon the inobedient perſons: if therefore God wills and determines that they ſhall reject and contemn his precepts and commands, how are they criminal?</p>

The ſenſe therefore of the whole verſe briefly is this, That God by his perpetual Providence and Government of the world, not only takes notice of, and regards good and holy men, that all things may tend to their welfare: but likewiſe beholds and obſerves the actions of wicked perſons; and that they may not think they ſhall go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, and ſay in their hearts, <hi>There is no God,</hi> moſt wiſely orders, that a juſt <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſis</hi> ſhall overtake them for their ſins and

               <p>I cannot ſee how this Text makes any thing for the <hi>Calviniſtical Reprobation;</hi> but there are ſome men ſo ſubtle and acute, that they eſpie ſomething or other for the patronizing and defending their ſelf-choſen opinions almoſt in every verſe of the holy Scriptures. That which they moſt aime at and would inforce from hence is, That this Excaecation and obduration is a Phyſical Action of God upon the mind, ariſing from his peremprory Decree of Reprobation <note n="*" place="margin">Sicut credere nolunt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probi, ita certum eſt non poſſe velle credere, quia tenebrae in quilus nati ſunt, lucem com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendere non poſſunt.

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42065:120"/> according to his purpoſe. For whom he did foreknow, he alſo did predeſtinate to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firſt-born amongst many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called, and whom he called, them he alſo juſtified: and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here (ſay the <hi>Calviniſts</hi>) you may ſee the chain of Salvation, and behold how the beloved of God are drawn by each golden link, till they are brought to their appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bliſs and happineſs. This is the ſacred method of Gods Predeſtination, in which he goes by certain ſteps and degrees, and in every one of them magnifies the riches of his free and undeſerved Grace to his choſen and ſelected ones. But to leave theſe light and aiery fancies, I ſhall lay down that which I judge to be the proper and genuine ſenſe of the Apoſtles words. In order to which we muſt know, That the ſcope and intent of almoſt this whole Chapter is, to comfort the Afflicted and calamitous, and to exhort them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtedfaſt and unmoved in the love of God, and obedience of his commands, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſeveral weighty Reaſons and Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to incite them to it, amongſt which theſe two have their ſtrength and cogency.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42065:120"/> 1. That all the troubles and moleſtations they ſuffer here, ſhall work together for their good, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. 2. In that they are predeſtinated to be conformed to the image of Chriſt, who through many hardſhips and afflictions made his way unto glory, <hi>ver.</hi> 20, 30. So that the Predeſtination here mentioned, is to be underſtood of a deſtination to the Croſs, and not of any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to Faith, Life and Glory. The ſum of all is this, That all afflictions and croſſes however burdenſome and grievous they may be, ſhall work together for the good of thoſe that love God, and ſincerely and cordially adhere and cleave unto him; and though now for the preſent they may be exerciſed with many hardſhips, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron'd with calamitous accidents: yet the event ſhould be glorious, and the Sun of comfort at laſt ariſe and diſpel thoſe thick clouds of ſorrow, and bring on a ſerene and perpetual day of felicity and joy. For whom he did approve of as faithful, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined ſhould arrive to their felicity by the ſame way that Chriſt did, who by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering entred into his Glory, to the intent that he might be the firſt-born among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny brethren. Moreover, whom he did thus approve of, them he intended to call to a conformity to his Son; and whom he
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42065:121"/> thus calls, he will likewiſe juſtifie, that is, account them as righteous; and whom he thus juſtifies, he will hereafter glorifie, if they deſert not the ſigns and tokens of the Croſs, as he ſaid before, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>If ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified together.</hi> For though there be no condition expreſſed, yet it is evidently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in the nature and matter of the thing it ſelf.

               <p>
                  <hi>Verſe</hi> 13. That the Text doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note in it's proper extent and ſignification the perſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> ſimply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, but their Poſterity, appears:</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the Reſponſe of God to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca,</hi> when ſhe complained upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens ſtrugling in her womb. <hi>Gen.</hi> xxv. 23. <hi>Two Nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people ſhall be ſeparated from thy bowels: and the one people ſhall be ſtronger then the other: and the elder ſhall ſerve the younger.</hi> Now 'tis plain, that the elder's ſubjection to the younger never had any completion in their life-time, but rather the contrary, as appears by their ſtory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Expreſſion [<hi>Jacob have I loved,</hi> &amp;c.] was not delivered or ſpoken before the birth of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> but ſome hundreds of years after; for it is no where
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42065:125"/> elſe to be found in Scripture, but in <hi>Mal.</hi> i. where the Prophet treats not of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> but of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities, the <hi>Edumeans</hi> and <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> it being no new thing to call whole Nations deſcending from the ſame linage, by the Brothers names from whom each ſprung, as <hi>Numb.</hi> xx. 14. <hi>Thus ſaith thy Brother Iſrael</hi> — and <hi>Deut.</hi> xxiii. 7. <hi>Thou ſhalt not abhor an Edomite, for he is thy Brother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, Neither the love nor hatred of God in this place has any relation to a peremptory Election to, or Reprobation from Eternal life and happineſs: For</p>
               <p n="1">1. If this were loving from eternity, God could not afterward have given <hi>Jacob</hi> and the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> a Law, annexing a conditional benediction to it: For that which God had decreed to them by an immutable and ſpecial Decree, could not be promiſed to them under the condition of obedience; for it implies a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that a thing ſhould be abſolute and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional at the ſame time, and to the ſame perſons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this love were abſolute and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Poſterity, they could not then have fallen from Gods grace and favour, which we find ſome of them did, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> iii. 19.</p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:42065:126"/>
               <p>As therefore the love here mentioned cannot ſignifie an Election to eternal life, ſo neither can the Hatred denote eternal Reprobation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe 'tis often taken otherwiſe in Scripture, comparatively for a leſs degree of love, and therefore may admit of a more candid interpretation: <hi>Deut.</hi> xxi. 15. <hi>If a man have two wives, one beloved and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hated,</hi> i. e. If he have one that he loves leſs then the other; For it being lawful at that time to divorce their wives, it would ſcarce ever happen, what the text implies, if hating were taken properly: for who would retain a wife that he really and truly hated, when he might put her away, and take another which he loved better. So <hi>Gen.</hi> xxviii. 31. <hi>When the Lord ſaw that Leah was hated,</hi> i. e. as in the precedent verſe, <hi>loved with a leſs degree of affection then Rachel.</hi> After the ſame manner muſt the words of Chriſt be expounded in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> xiv. 26. <hi>If any man cometh to me, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and hateth not his Father and Mother</hi> — i. e. <hi>if he love not me more then them, he cannot be a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That cannot be the object of ſuch an eternal and implacable hatred, which hath no cauſe of hatred in it; but <hi>Eſau</hi> had
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42065:126"/> no cauſe in him, that God ſhould thus hate him: <hi>Before the children had done good or evil.</hi>

And hence the Apoſtle gives an indication of the fruitleſs attempts of the Jews in contending with ſo much zeal and noiſe for the obedience of the Law, when God required faith in his Son whom he had ſent into the world of them, and had openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that men ſhould be accounted righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, not by the works of the Law, but by the faith of the Goſpel.</p>

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>[hardens]</hi> is by many miſunderſtood, and therefore will need ſome explication: That God hardened <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart the Scripture teſtifies, but of the manner how it was done we are now to enquire. Some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this <hi>hardning of the heart</hi> to be a poſitive act of God, either by conveying a
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42065:127"/> new degree of obſtinacy and refractori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into it, or by intending and corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating that which was in it before: But this is neither agreeable to the purity and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Divine Nature, nor conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous to any Oeconomy which God has yet manifeſted to the World; for his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is ſuch that he cannot be the cauſe or Author of any Impurity or Rebellion, which this way of ſolution would certainly charge upon him. The Reverend and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his Annotations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this place obſerves, <hi>That God is not ſaid to harden</hi> Pharaoh<hi>'s heart (although he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted it before in</hi> Chap. iv. 21. &amp; vii. 3.) <hi>till after the ſixt judgment, and the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſpecial warning given him by</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>before that, and then 'tis ſaid,</hi> Exod. ix. 12. <hi>as it were in a new ſtyle,</hi> The Lord hardens <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart: By which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of time when God hardned <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s heart, he thinks it will appear what is the proper intimation of hardning, <hi>viz. The total ſubſtraction of Gods grace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance from him, in the ſame manner as when one is caſt into Hell, which</hi> Pharaoh <hi>at that time had been, had it not been more for Gods Glory to continue him alive a while in that deſperate, irreverſible condition, which ſure was no whit worſe to him, but
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42065:128"/> ſomewhat better and more deſirable, then to have been adjudged to thoſe flames all that time.</hi> But methinks (with ſubmiſſion to more excellent judgments) the main of this Explication is not ſo ſolid, ſo rational and coherent as might be deſired: For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It may very well be queſtion'd, Whether thoſe plagues which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on him after the immiſſion of the ſixt judgment, and conſequently after God is ſaid <hi>to harden his heart,</hi> were not as effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious for his amendment, and ſo deſigned of God, as any of the former? That they were ſufficiently convictive, and of force and power enough to ſubdue and conquer his untamed ſpirit, if he would have made a right uſe of them, is evident, as well from Gods upbraiding the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of incredulity upon this very reaſon and account, that they refuſed to be wrought upon by thoſe many notable miracles and ſigns done in the midſt of them, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxix, 2, 3, 4. as from the temporarious penitence, and ſuddain ſenſibility of his miſcarriage which the actual and preſent immiſſion of judgment drew from him, <hi>Exod.</hi> ix. 27, 28. <hi>I have ſinned this time</hi> — and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Chap.</hi> x. 16, 17. That thoſe after-judgments were alſo intended of God for the emendation of this obſtinate King is I
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42065:128"/> think as clear from the expoſtulation of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> with him, <hi>Exod.</hi> x. 3. 4. <hi>How long wilt thou refuſe to humble thy ſelf? Let my people go</hi> — which plainly ſuppoſes, both that the deſignation of the Judgment was to humble him; and that there was a poſſibility ſtill of reducing him to that pliable and ſequacious temper. And if it were otherwiſe, theſe and the like menaces and threatnings <hi>[If thou refuſe to let my people go, I will do thus and thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee]</hi> would be wholly ſupervacaneous and ineffectual: Nay they would argue an unworthy exprobration in God of his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate detention of the people, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal to ſubmit to his will, when he had not ſtrength and power ſufficient to attempt the contrary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may well be doubted, Whether that Divine Goodneſs which is alwayes ready to breath upon the leaſt ſpark of the life of God in every rational Being, and aſſiſts every good motion and forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards the formation of Gods holy image in every man, would not likewiſe have been as urgent and efficacious in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> for the mollifying his obdurate ſpirit before he was taken out of the world, had he rightly and duly managed thoſe heavy puniſhments in order to his melioration,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42065:129"/> 
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> if he would have complyed with the will of God. The ſum of all therefore ſeems to be this, That Almighty God the ever-wiſe and benign Creator of all things, being conſcious to all the affections, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues and hidden receſſes of the ſpirit of Man, only knows how and when to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a ſoveraign remedy; and like a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chirurgion proportions his medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the nature and quality of the wound, and ſeldom makes uſe of thoſe more ungentle wayes of cauterizing and exciſion, till neceſſity and the preſervation of the whole urge him to it. And even in this ſingular inſtance of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> we may trace the footſteps of Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity and love, as that Holy and Pious Father excellently well obſerves,<note place="margin">Origen. Philocal. cap. <hi>27.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Againſt the firſt of theſe I ſhall lay down theſe Concluſions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he is a true and ſincere Believer, who hath to his utmoſt endeavours ſo mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and ſubdued the body of ſin, that he willingly harbours no vice, nor takes any complacency in the impure motions of the brutiſh life: but through a fixed belief in the Goodneſs of God diſplayed unto mankind through the Lord Chriſt, reſolutely preſſes forward to higher mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and degrees of Chriſtian perfection, and inceſſantly breaths after a fuller par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Divine Nature. Such a
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42065:132"/> man I look upon to be truly regenerate and born anew of the Spirit of God, and to be affected, according to his proportion, as Chriſt himſelf was affected, when he dwelt on earth, and converſed with men. And though this Divine life, diſpread and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt it ſelf by ſucceſſive acts, and ſhine not ſo full and bright as when it is near it's Center: yet it is as truly a God-like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as an Infant is a Man, though he be not ſo in growth and ſtature. It is nothing but our ſelfwill which ſtands out againſt heaven, and keeps ſuch an impregnable fort againſt the grace of God; and whoever is truly dead to it, and receives the gentle impreſſions of the Divine Spirit into his ſoul, and acts correſpondently to ſo holy a principle, he is certainly in the Land of Life and Truth, and partakes of that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Nature, which cannot reſt among the duſt and rubbiſh of this lower World: but ſeparates whatever is heterogeneous in the ſoul of man, and by perpetual and ſucceſsful attempts, reſtores again thoſe Divine forms which ſhone gloriouſly in humane minds before their unfortunate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion and retrogradation from the lucid fountain of their everlaſting joy and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:42065:133"/>2. The firſt actings of Grace in ſuch a Man as I have above deſcribed, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together undiſcernible and imperceptible, being nothing elſe but the preparatory Exertions of that Almighty Goodneſs, the Source and Father of all things, for the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and adapting Men to receive the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Image and Form of the Holy Jeſus, according to the words of the Lord Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> vi. 44. <hi>No man can come unto me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Father which hath ſent me draw him:</hi> and in this the Nature of Man is wholly paſſive; and the only thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to him is to ſee that he do not obſtruct and hinder the progreſs of that efficacious Love, by a cowardly ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the importunate motions of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and unhallowed actions. Now the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxes and operations of this Vital Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, are coeval with the firſt actings of Reaſon and diſcriminative Perception, and extend themſelves according to the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the intellectual Powers: but no man is any more conſcious of it's energy, then of the growth of his bones; for ſo he that made the Nature of man and knows his frame, hath told us, <hi>Luke</hi> xvii. 20. <hi>The Kingdom of God, cometh not with obſervation:</hi> And <hi>Mark</hi> iv. 26, 27. <hi>So is the Kingdom of God, as if a man ſhould
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42065:133"/> caſt ſeed into the ground, and ſhould ſleep, and riſe night and day, and the ſeed ſhould ſpring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</hi> And when men are <hi>born again <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> (as Chriſt calls his Father, <hi>John</hi> xv. 1.) it breaks through the clods and ſprings up, being cheriſhed by the dew of heaven, and the warmth of that immortal fire which paſſeth through the intellectual world, and melts and refines every lapſed Being from the contracted filth of material concretions; and no man can ſay, Lo here I was caught by the breath of God, or lo there was my reſurrection from the comfortleſs grave of ſin and death;<note place="margin">John. iii. 8.</note> For as <hi>the wind bloweth where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof, but canſt not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit.</hi> But this I would have underſtood of the ordinary way of Gods diſpenſing his Grace, and not of that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural manner whereby he conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Saul,</hi> caſting him down to the Earth by a voice from heaven, nor of the diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Spirit to the Heathens when firſt converted to the faith: For ſuch (as alſo notorious and groſs ſinners) may have ſome ſenſibility of Divine Vegetation, and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42065:134"/> apprehenſion of ſome external circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces attending the New-birth unto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. But for thoſe who are born and educated under Chriſtian Parents, our Church hath excellently well determined in the ſervice and office of Baptiſme, <hi>That they are Regenerated and born again, not only of Water, but of the Spirit, by which their Natures are Sanctified;</hi> as we read of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> who <hi>received the ſpirit of holineſs, and were hallowed from their Mothers wombs;</hi> and for any man to enquire of ſuch, or for them curiouſly to ſearch after ſome preternatural ſtirrings and motions of the Divine Spirit in their ſouls, by which to diſcern the firſt dawnings of the grace of God upon them, is as impertinent as it would be to demand of them when firſt they heard or perceived the nutrition and augmentation of the parts of their Natural bodies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The uſual way and method by which the firſt diſſeminators of the Goſpel im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted and begot the image of Chriſt in the minds of men was, by exhorting them in the firſt place, to the plain and obvious duties and exerciſes of Morality, ſuch as Juſtice and Equity, Temperance and Chaſtity, great love and compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:42065:134"/> all men, relieving and comforting the neceſſitous and calamitous according to their ſeveral wants and indigencies, and ſuch like acts of Virtue and Reaſon, which are the preparatory qualifications for the introducing the Divine Spirit to attempt the formation of the living Image of Jeſus Chriſt; and between theſe and the Divine life, there is the ſame cognation as between the blade and the full-ear'd corn. For it is utterly impoſſible to conceive the life of God without them, or to imagine that he can be really Baptiz'd into the life and ſpirit of Jeſus, who is unjuſt to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and unpitiful and contemptive of the compaſſionate needs and ſighs of his poor Brother. It is ſufficiently ſeen, and the ſad experience of every man will declare it to him, how deplorably Apoſtate our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are, when we firſt come into the World; and how vitiouſly inclined our ſouls when they begin to exert themſelves in acts of Reaſon and Intellect: ſo that they appear almoſt breathleſs and inactive to the concerns of Immortality, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever offers to better their condition, and pull them out of the mire and clay wherein their feet are held. And to think that God will forcibly draw them out, and hale them like unwilling captives into a ſtate to which
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:42065:135"/> they have no cognation or vital congruity awakened in them; beſide that it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to his ſpotleſs and pure Nature, it is likewiſe inconſiſtent with the nature of the thing it ſelf, conſidering mens minds ſo vitiated, and totally diſcompoſed by a long and aſſiduous inflexion and diſtortion to degenerate Vice. For Divine generations as well as Natural, require a ſutable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionateneſs, and as every matter is not capable of conciliating and uniting with every formative principle: ſo neither is every temper of humane ſouls congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diſpoſed for the inaction of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, which never falls to work, but where the ſubject is rendred plyable and ſequacious by timely preparations and fit diſpoſitions and capacities. And if it were otherwiſe, that meer Power, or the Naked Preſence of the Divine Eſſence diſpreading it ſelf through the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were ſufficient to give us any hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful expectation of our Spiritual Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by it, without any precedent aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or fitting diſpoſitions, I do not ſee how this boundleſs and compaſſionate Goodneſs can behold the World in ſo ſad and miſerable a plight, the whole Earth being filled with Violence, and the Habitations of cruelty and Oppreſſion,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:42065:135"/> and mens ſpirits ſo degenerated, that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their outward ſhape, and a little more cunning and craft in contriving and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting ſelf-deſigns and intereſts, they are hardly diſtinguiſhable from the Beaſts of the field; I do not ſee (I ſay) how that Love, which is the inmoſt centre of the Deity, and from whence flow all the perfective irradiations of his bleſſed Nature, can behold the ſons of men ſo unlike himſelf, and yet not reform and change them, ſince the buſineſs lies wholly upon the exertion of his Almighty Power. But we finding no ſuch thing, we may confidently averr, that there are ſome precedaneous qualifications requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the perfection of the Divine birth, and theſe can be no other then Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, purity and abſtracted affections from Mundane forms, Chaſtity and moderation of bodily pleaſures, and a dear and tender regard of the whole Creation. Which things have ſo near an affinity with the Divine life, that the one neceſſarily inferres the preſence and exiſtence of the other, theſe requiſites being the baſis and foundation upon which the heavenly building is framed:<note place="margin">1 King. vi. 7.</note> now as in the ſtructure of the material Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there was <hi>neither ſound of ax nor ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;</hi>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:42065:136"/> in like manner that heavenly edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which the Eternal Architect endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to erect in the ſoul of every man, is compleated and perfected without any ſound or noiſe, the Holy Jeſus neither crying nor lifting up his voice in the ſtreets, to give a ſign of his approach when he renews and forms his image in the ſons of men. For that image which God ſhapes out in our Natures, is not any thing different and diſtinct from our moral and inherent Righteouſneſs, or any new infuſed quality; but the exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and freeing of that principle which though weak and depreſſed by a load of corruption; yet being immortal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, bears a Divine ſtamp, and exerts it ſelf in acts of Sobriety, Juſtice and Goodneſs, and being aſſiſted and corroborated by the powerful conduct of the Spirit of God, ſucceſſively diſplayes it ſelf, and continually ariſes to greater meaſures, till the living efformation of Chriſt be perfectly compleated. An inſtance of this we have in <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> x. and the more devout and religious Heathens, in whom the life of God was in a good meaſure radicated, and diſcovered it ſelf in his frequent Prayers and Charitable actions; who when he was renewed and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:42065:136"/> ſanctified by the gracious illapſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, was not deveſted of thoſe Moral accompliſhments of his Nature, or endued with any thing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from them; but his Righteouſneſs and perfections of his mind were increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſublimated, and fitted for the relliſhing ſuch delicate and tender impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: which things being ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it cannot be that any one ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the beginning, or determine the time of the vegetation and increaſe of the Divine Image and Nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond illation which concludes the infallible certainty of his Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance who is once in a ſtate of Grace, and collects himſelf to be under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable decree of life by thoſe Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteriſticks delivered from the mouth of no mean Dictator of that pleaſing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; as it is deſtructive of Piety and caſts a malevolent aſpect upon true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Virtue: ſo it hath not the leaſt print or footſtep in the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, nor can alledge any thing but fancy and the prejudice of impotent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to maintain it's credit in the world, as will appear from theſe ſubſequent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:42065:137"/>1. That the Decrees of God, whether of life or death, look upon men according to the exigency and import of their preſent ſtates and conditions, not of their poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial or future Beings. As ſuppoſe God foreſee and diſcern, that this man righteous at preſent, will hereafter forſake his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and apoſtatize from the holy Commandement and do wickedly; yet ſo long as he continues righteous, he is under the favourable eye of Heaven, and is trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as one whoſe name is written in the Book of Life. <hi>Whoſoever doth righteouſneſs, is righteous: but he that committeth ſin, is of the Devil</hi> — 1 Joh. iii. 7, 8. And more plainly yet, <hi>The righteouſneſs of the righteous, ſhall not deliver him in the day of his tranſgreſsion: as for the wickedneſs of the wicked, he ſhall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> — Ezek. xxxiii. 12, 13, 14, 15. The reſult of theſe places, is this, That par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men, or the perſons of men, from time to time, come under the Eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Love or Hatred, according to their actual and preſent ſtate of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or unrighteouſneſs. For if God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed life and death upon the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of future ſin and holineſs, he may as well decree a reward and puniſhment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:42065:137"/> for that which men would have been engaged in, had they lived in this World to all eternity; which directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts that Scripture wherein we are ſaid to give an account for the things which we have already done, not which we ſhould have done, had we continued longer in the body. And hence it is that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man, who is now in the love and favour of God, being hardned again through his own negligence and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of ſin, may relapſe into that ſtate, which the Decree of death takes hold of: and of ſuch a man is that of St. <hi>Peter</hi> to be underſtood, 2 <hi>Peter</hi> ii. 21. <hi>It had been better for ſuch a man not to have known the way of righteouſneſs; then after he hath known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to him.</hi> And when the righteous man degenerates from his former faith, and the enemy takes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and oppreſſes the Divine life through his careleſſneſs and folly, God charges all his paſt ſins upon him, and recals his juſtification whereby he was before eſteemed as righteous in his ſight; which is intimated in the Parable <hi>Matth.</hi> xviii. where he that had the debt forgiven him, becauſe he dealt ſo harſhly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently with his Fellow-ſervant, was again
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42065:138"/> called in queſtion, and the whole ſumme charged upon him; and Chriſt applies it to our preſent purpoſe, <hi>verſe</hi> 35. <hi>So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhall my heavenly Father do alſo unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his Brother their treſpaſſes.</hi> For we muſt know that God pardons our iniquities by parts; and as we grow in Virtue and Holineſs, ſo his diſpleaſure decreaſes and is taken off, and he that is <hi>juſtified becomes yet more juſtified,</hi> and walks in the light, and the breath of God enkindles the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly fire, and fans it into flames and ardors, and ſo long the man is ſafe: but if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to folly, the anger of God is renewed as at the beginning, and the <hi>laſt ſtate of that man is worſe then the firſt.</hi>

               <p>WHat I mean by <hi>Moral Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> I have declared elſewhere; and therefore ſhall only in brief add, That Moral Goodneſs is nothing but an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, harmony or convenience; ſo that things are then Morally Good, when they correſpond and unite with the inward ſenſe of our ſouls, that is, with our Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual or Rational Natures: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity when we feel in our ſelves we call thoſe things good. And whatever is really and truly Good, is immutably and eternally ſo, not made ſo by any poſitive ſanction of command: but the reſult of Gods own Moral Being, which he can no more ſwarve from, then deſtroy himſelf.

               <head>Axiome <hi>II.</hi> That of that which is good, one is better then another.</head>
               <p>THis is evident from the difference and gradual declenſion of lives from the firſt root and center of all Beings. There is no life ſo languid and unactive, but ought to be reckoned among thoſe things that are good; becauſe Being ſimply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, is better and more deſirable then not Being, although the more noble any Being is, ſo much the better it is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And as there is this difference in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Beings themſelves; ſo likewiſe in reference to their felicity, both in regard of it's magnitude and duration: Thus the felicity of men is better then that of Brute Animals: for the Happineſs of any creature conſiſts in the free enjoyment and exerciſe of it's natural faculties and endowments, and the larger and more comprehenſive the the faculties and capacities of any Being are, the greater is it's felicity. As to durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that a longer is better than a ſhorter Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it is ſo palpable that it needs no further mentioning. And this rule holds good in Moral qualities and affections:
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:42065:145"/> Power it ſelf is a Perfection; though as to it's exerciſe, it be indifferent either to Good or Evill: but Wiſedome is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then Power, foraſmuch as it is able to direct, guide and ſteer the reſults of Power; otherwiſe Wiſdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge would include no more perfection, then the force of a Thunderbolt, or the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious agitation of a whirlwind. And Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is more excellent and pretious then Wiſdom, for Wiſdom without Goodneſs degenerates into Craft and Subtlety: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the properties and effects of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are more diffuſive and deſirable then Knowledge, and more perfective of the ſubject they reſide in.</p>

And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience ſhews us how unable and unfit we are for the exerciſe of any functions of life, when a ſharp and acute pain ſeazes on us; and if this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:42065:148"/> ſenſe be fierce, vehement and durable, it is a queſtion, Whether it will not perfectly extinguiſh all Vital congruity, and reduce us to a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion altogether the ſame with Non-Entity?

For certainly though in a moral ſenſe we may piouſly ſay, That all things were made for man; yet to ſay, There is no other Phyſical Reaſon of their Beings, is too bold and preſumptuous an Aſſertion, they being (ſo many I mean as are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſenſe) endued with faculties in whoſe uſe they enjoy and ſolace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

               <p>Having laid down theſe Moral Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which are nothing but the plain and genuine productions of Right Reaſon, I ſhall now examine the Authors Diſcourſe by them, and ſhew wherein his Arguments are weak and inconcluſive in reference to bis main deſign.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing therefore that I ſhall take notice of is, his ſtating the true ground and foundation of Gods Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Dominion over man, <hi>page</hi> 20, 21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he does by Arbitrating the Diſpute between the <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts;</hi> the one aſſert, <hi>That it bottoms upon the Benefit of Creation;</hi> and the other <hi>groud it upon the unlimitedneſs of Gods Power.</hi> The firſt of theſe (he ſayes) <hi>are evidently miſtaken, becauſe God was from all eternity inveſted with a Power of doing any thing that was not misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming his Divine Perfections — but God being alwayes Infnitely Perfect, could not acquire any new Excellence from the Worlds Creation, and therefore the Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Benefits cannot beget any new Power in him; becauſe the Power which he had
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:42065:149"/> antecedently to all his benefits, was not capable of being made greater —</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I Reply,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Dominion and Power, as it ſignifies Sovereignty, are Relative terms, and therefore if we could ſuppoſe or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any time wherein there were no Creatures in Being, Dominion would then be improperly attributed to God; becauſe if he had Dominion, there muſt be ſome Subjects exiſtent of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: and therefore though God by creating the World, acquired no new Excellence or Perfection; yet he had ſome new Mode or Qualification which he had not before: as that he was the Father of the Intellectual, and Maker of the Corporeal World; which would be improper terms before he had brought any thing into Being. Thus although God know, and have as it were a perfect Scheme of all future things poſſible to be known; yet his conception or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſame thing when future and poſſible, and actually exiſtent, is not the ſame; for when it is actually brought into Being, he acquires a new manner of knowledge of it; for it is impoſſible that the conception of futurity and actual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence ſhould be the ſame. Therefore
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:42065:150"/> I ſay, though the Creation of an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Being, do not formally beget any new Power in God, which was not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently in him; yet it begets a new mode and qualification of his Power, whereby the Creature may juſtly expect to be dealt withal according to the Nature and capacities, which that Infinite Power placed in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Collation of Benefits, inveſts the Creatures with a Right or Priviledge of juſtly hoping for all ſuch fair and equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dealings from God, as ſhall beſt ſute with thoſe faculties he endued them withal. For Gods very Donation of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Creatures, is as it were, a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent contract or promiſe, That his whole Oeconomy towards them, ſhall be equal and righteous, and that he will never take from them any the leaſt degree of that felicity and beatitude he was graciouſly pleaſed to conferr upon them at the firſt moment of their Exiſtence without their own ſin and fault.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe grounds our Author might with greater plauſibility of Reaſon, have founded <hi>Gods Dominion</hi> upon the <hi>Right of Creation,</hi> then upon <hi>Gods abſolute and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Power,</hi> which he confeſſes <hi>page</hi> 24. to <hi>be bounded by an internal Principle of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:42065:150"/> Goodneſs, which may be ſaid to tye and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain God not to do any thing repugnant to this Principle of Goodneſs.</hi> So that if the exerciſe of Power be limited and confined by this precious Attribute of Goodneſs, this were a more ſure ground of Gods Dominion over the Creatures in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, then that which he hath pitched upon, as will appear from <hi>Axiome</hi> III. And to ſay, that the Reaſon why God cannot do any thing repugnant to his Goodneſs, proceeds from a circumſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>ſet and chooſe by himſelf, which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tranſgreſs becauſe he will not,</hi> is to introduce an Arbitrary Deity, and very much Derogatory to his ſpotleſs Nature, whoſe Goodneſs, Juſtice and Holineſs are as neceſſary as his Exiſtence; therefore that God cannot act any thing indecorous and unbecoming himſelf, ariſes not from any Reſtraint or Confinement arbitrarily impoſed upon himſelf: but from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Perfection of his Nature, and from thoſe Eternal and Immutable laws of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Righteouſneſs, which are nothing but his own Moral Being. That I may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more fully declare the weakneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validity of this conceit of our Author, <hi>viz. That Arbitrary Power is the ground of Gods Sovereignty and Dominion over his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:42065:151"/> I ſhall endeavour to enervate thoſe Propoſitions, by which he would ſtrengthen and confirm it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt then (ſayes he <hi>page</hi> 5.) <hi>God has Power either utterly to deſtroy our Beings, or to inflict upon us ſo many calamities as ſhall leave us in a condition only preferable to that of Non-Exiſtence —</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we ſpeak of God, our concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of him ought to be Generous and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and we ought to look upon him as an Eternal Rectitude and Perfection, who never acts any thing but in conformity to his own bleſſed and righteous Nature. Now that pregnant Womb which brought forth the whole Creation, being Infinite Goodneſs by <hi>Axiome</hi> III. it will follow, that the ſame Goodneſs is infinitely concerned to keep in Being the productions of it's own fertile Nature; for though it be true, that our very Beings, are the iſſues of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Power: yet it is as certain, that this Power is ſurrounded with Immenſe Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which from the Reaſons of it's own Nature, will infallibly do all that Good which at any time lies in it's Power to do, and is conſiſtent with the Nature and Capacities of the ſubject, about which it is exerciſed. Since then Being is better then Not-being, and all Creatures capable
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:42065:151"/> of an Eternal Duration, as well of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing one day or year, Infinite Goodneſs is obliged to keep all things in Being. The further proof of this ſhall be ſhewed anon. I might here likewiſe ſuggeſt to Mr. <hi>P.</hi> that Things are the bleſſed emanations of Gods exuberant Goodneſs, and depend upon him as emanative effects upon their cauſes; nor will this be invalidated by Objecting, <hi>That then God could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid to have Created the World; For beſides that</hi> Aquinas <hi>himſelf defines Creation by</hi> Actus Emanativus, <hi>there is no Incongruity</hi> (ſay they) <hi>to affirme, that all things are the Emanative effects of Gods pregnant Goodneſs; becauſe, to Create is nothing but to give Being or Exiſtence to things; and this is true, though every thing be an Emanative effect of Gods Life and Eſſential Vigour.</hi> This I look upon to be as Rational and Concinnous an Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, as that wherein Mr. <hi>P.</hi> attributes ſuch a Sovereignty and Dominion of God over his Creatures (the baſis of which is Unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Power) as that he may at any time either annihilate them, or inflict upon them ſo many calamities as ſhall render their conditions only preferable to Non-Exiſtence.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:42065:152"/>2. His ſecond Propoſition is only a further Enlargement and Explication of his firſt; <hi>For if God</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>have an Abſolute Power over an innocent Perſons life, and all it's appendant Priviledges to take them away, he may certainly do the ſame upon any occaſion. Thus he viſits the Iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children, by bringing their Poſterity into thoſe evil circumſtances, into which he might have brought them by vertue of his Supreme Dominion; though not only themſelves, but their Progenitors had been faultleſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, That there is no inſtance in Scripture, wherein God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes an innocent Perſon by vertue of his Supreme Dominion. 'Tis true, when God inflicts Calamities upon the Children for their Parents faults, the Poſterity are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of thoſe particular Crimes of their Progenitors which cauſed the Judgment or Calamity; but they were criminal otherwiſe, and therefore if God take away their lives, it is upon this account, that they have rendred themſelves obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by their Perſonal faults, and by that Oeconomy, ſerves other deſigns of his Providence. Wherefore when God takes away the life of a Virtuous Son to puniſh a Wicked Father, it is not properly to
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:42065:152"/> be accounted an Evil to the Son, becauſe Gods righteous Providence compenſates it with a greater Good. See <hi>Axiome</hi> VI. From theſe particular inſtances, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to the conſideration of Original ſin, which he places in nothing but in the evil and irregular <hi>craſis</hi> and temperament of our bodies, which Puniſhment might have been inflicted upon us, though <hi>Adam</hi> had never ſinned: But</p>
               <p n="1">1. Can this ſute with the eternal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the juſt Governour of the World, to Create Intellectual Beings, holy and good; and then without any fault of theirs, to thruſt them into ſuch cadave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous bodies, where they ſhall be almoſt neceſſitated to trade with Hell and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and it may be never recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from that Lethargick ſtate of ſin and vice, or regain their ancient and virtuous freedom? And though Mr. <hi>P.</hi> ſhift this off upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s Prevarication and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; yet he ſayes, <hi>The Conſideration of Gods Sovereignty and Dominion, will warrant ſuch an Act upon guiltleſs Perſons.</hi> Sure Mr. <hi>P.</hi> has a very mean conceit of Gods moſt Bleſſed Nature, if he think thoſe beautiful Daughters of Heaven, the ſouls of men, can be thus murder'd by thoſe Benign Hands that firſt gave them life:
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42065:153"/> Had he conſidered that glorious beauty, wherewith the ſoul of Man was once poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, and of which now that ſhe is born into the World ſhe retains but a very ſlender memory, converſing with it as it were in a Dream, and beholding a glimpſe of it through the cranies of Mortality, and had he beheld this Eternal Pulchritude thrown from it's Celeſtial Manſion, and all thoſe living rayes of Virtue, and efflo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſcences of Divinity plunged into an obſcure and dull piece of Earth, and that by the Bleſſed Author of all things, he could not but infinitely reſent ſuch an harſh Act.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Are not all our faculties very much depraved and vitiated, inſomuch that there is in us a natural proclivity to Vice, and we dayly make choice of forbidden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances? Are not our Underſtandings very dark and blind, our Wills refractory and ſtubborn, and our Affections violent and head-ſtrong for the moſt part in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of baſe and unworthy objects? And if this be our Caſe as we come into the World, as certainly it is, and much worſe, Original ſin muſt be a real depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of our ſouls, and not an ill tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our bodies.</p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:42065:153"/>
               <p>The Author having determined the Meaſure and Extent of Gods Sovereignty and Dominion, according to his own fancy and humour, he endeavours <hi>page</hi> 25. to frame ſuch an <hi>Idea</hi> of Divine Goodneſs as may correſpond with the Notion he hath pitched upon of Gods Dominion, and therefore he tells us, That <hi>the</hi> Idea <hi>of God conſiſts mainly in his Dominion and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, and that the Notion of him in Scripture never refers to his Eſſence, but alwayes to his Power and Empire —</hi> But he muſt give me leave to take the ſame liberty in rejecting ſo bold an Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he does in obtruding it upon the World; however, I ſhall be ſo fair and candid to him, as not to contradict what he ſayes, without ſhewing him a Reaſon for it: The moſt conſiſtent <hi>Idea</hi> that we can frame of God is, That he is a Being endued with Abſolute Perfection; now there are no Perfections in the Deity, but what may be referred to theſe three, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Goodneſs, Wiſdom and Power, which being not of equal worth and excellency by <hi>Axiome</hi> II. it will follow, That what is moſt pretious, is likewiſe moſt active and energetical, and therefore muſt be the ſtandard and meaſure of all the reſt, by <hi>Axiome</hi> III. and IV. Wherefore, when
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:42065:154"/> we frame any Notion, or make any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of God, Reaſon it ſelf will tell us, That we ought to expreſs him by that which is moſt pretious and Sovereign in him, which is not <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> but <hi>Perfect Goodneſs.</hi> And methinks the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture mightily favours this, 1 <hi>John</hi> iv. 16. <hi>God is Love,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle; which No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if it refer not to Gods <hi>Moral Eſſence,</hi> I am ſure it hath no relation to his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Empire.</hi> It is true, when the <hi>Jews</hi> dwelt under a <hi>Theocracy,</hi> and God went forth as their Captain againſt their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he owned the Title of the Lord of Hoſts, and the Expreſſions of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power, Majeſty and Dominion, were more frequent: but when the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Oeconomy was ſet on foor, God laid aſide theſe Titles, and now he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes himſelf by no other Attributes but what carry abundance of ſweetneſs along with them, and wholly refer and lead us to the conſideration of that which is the Flower and Summity of his Being, that is, <hi>Love.</hi> Therefore I may ſubjoyn Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s. own words with a little Tranſpoſition,<note place="margin">Pag. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>That no Property which complies not with Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, can be attributed to God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that that's a falſe Notion of his Dominion that interferes with his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:42065:154"/>
               <p>Let us ſee now how he confutes the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> with whom he is very angry for aſſerting, <hi>That God being Infnite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will neceſſarily do that which is beſt, page</hi> 27. His firſt Argument to prove the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> falſity of this Poſition he ſets down <hi>page</hi> 29, 30. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſum of which in brief is this, <hi>That the neceſſity of Infinite Wiſdom doing that which is beſt, takes away the liberty and freedom of the Divine Will.</hi> To which I anſwer, That the liberty of the Divine Will conſiſts not in an Arbitrary Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of acting or not acting; but in acting alwayes ſutably and conformablely to his own Infinite Rectitude and Perfection: As the true Excellency and Freedom of our wills conſiſts not in an indifferency or dubious ſuſpenſion between Good and Evil (for this is a debility and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in us) but in a conſtant Election of that which Right Reaſon and Intellect propound to them as Beſt: So that when once that Eternal Providence which ſent us down upon Earth, ſhall reinſtate us in the Poſſeſſion of our Native Glory, our Wills which ſhall then obtain their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in it's greateſt latitude and dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, yet ſhall not be left to a bare In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency: but will as certainly adhere to that which is Good, as a wiſe and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42065:155"/> prudent man will alwayes give the ſame judgment of the ſame thing in the ſame circumſtances. Wherefore to anſwer in ſhort, I ſay, that Gods actions are not ſo fatal and neceſſary as the motions of an <hi>Automaton</hi> or <hi>Engine,</hi> becauſe he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with an Energetical Power of Reaſon and Intellect; but are free and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by any external Principle: but becauſe his Nature is infinitely Good, it will alwayes do that which is Beſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Goodneſs is the chief and firſt active Principle in it. The proof of this lies in <hi>Axiome</hi> II. III. IV.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> His ſecond Argument is this, <hi>That if the Divine Goodneſs or Beneficence be neceſſary, it would then deſtroy it's own Nature, becauſe 'tis abſolutely neceſſary to the Nature of Beneficence, that it proceed from a free and elective Principle, page</hi> 33.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe this Argument is only caſt in as a ſurpluſage, and not with any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to convince any of his Readers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Mr. <hi>P.</hi> imagine them ſo unwary and credulous as to be impoſed upon by fallacies and ſophiſms; For if by Gods Bounty and Beneficence, he mean his gracious Donations and Benefits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:42065:155"/> what may render his Creatures happy in their ſeveral ſtates and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities; then, I ſay, it is moſt free, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when any Beings have forfeited their Felicity, God is not obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtate them in all the circumſtances of it again: But if we take Bounty or Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the Eternal Perfection of Gods Bleſſed Nature, whereby he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates himſelf to all capable receptacles, this is as neceſſary as his Being: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Mr. <hi>P.</hi> ought properly to have levell'd his Argument. Nor does this make the Divine Goodneſs ever a whit the leſs Moral, becauſe then none of Gods actions would be capable of Being Morally Good; for this impoſſible and blaſphemous to aſſert, That the Divine Will is indifferent either to Good or Evill. God doth neceſſarily Love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as the higheſt and moſt Abſolute Good, and cannot but embrace every thing that is like himſelf; nor is the Divine Will Indifferent either to Love or Hate it's own Image and Similitude. And if the Communications of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodneſs to ſuch Beings as bear his Impreſſes upon them, and never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed themſelves with the leaſt contagion of ſin and vice be not neceſſary, then
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:42065:156"/> he is left free to deſtroy them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently he can deſtroy ſomething of his own Life and Nature, which no ſober Perſon will affirm. And if this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis of his be true, I know no ground Mankind can have (ſetting aſide thoſe Declarations God hath made of himſelf in Holy Scripture) to believe and truſt in him, and depend upon him for the advancement of their happineſs after Death.

                  <hi>If the Exertions of the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be neceſſary, God can never act other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:42065:156"/> but that he frequently does, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in all the Inſtances of his Anger and Severity, which not only Reaſon, but Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture oppoſes to Benignity —</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I return,</p>
               <p>That Gods anger and ſeverity are only ſeveral modifications of his Goodneſs, which is not alwayes diſplayed and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted after the ſame manner, becauſe of the different capacities of the ſubjects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which it is exerciſed, and have no other diſtinction then that of divers Modes of the ſame Subject between one another. And when God makes uſe of thoſe ſharper diſpenſations, they are as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary reſults of his Goodneſs, as his milder and gentler Oeconomy. So that I cannot ſee what Mr. <hi>P.</hi> would evince from this.</p>
               <p>I have now ſufficiently tired my ſelf in ſo prolix a Refutation, which yet is not altogether unneceſſary, conſidering that if thoſe Poſitions be true which Mr. <hi>P.</hi> hath laid down, they will ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate all thoſe Arguments I have made uſe of, and render my deſign uſeleſs, which is no other then to beget in mens minds the moſt noble and generous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
