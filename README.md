1. GODS GOODNESS VINDICATED, Againſt Abſolute Reprobation.

    _ CHAP. I. Inconditionate Reprobation inconſiſtent with the Declarations of God in Holy Scripture.

      * Prop. 1.1. To render any being in a far worſe condition, and more miſerable ſtate, then it's nature and capacities were intended for, without any conſideration of an antecedent Crime, or Subſequent advantage accruing, meerly upon will and pleaſure, is repugnant to the light of natural Reaſon.

      * 2. To determine by an abſolute and poſitive act the Happineſs of ſome,Prop. 2. and the Miſery of others, and yet to Decree the ſame upon condition of their Obedience or Diſobedience, is inconſiſtent with the light of Reaſon.

      * 3.Prop. 3. To command men to Act according to a Law under a certain and ſevere Puniſhment, and yet to take away all Power and Ability of Acting according to the Tenor of that Law, is contrary to the dictates of Right Reaſon.

      * 4.Prop. 4. That to Create and bring into Being on purpoſe to deſtroy and make miſerable, is moſt irrational.

      * 1. That there is ſomething Soveraign in the Deity, which is the root and ſpring of all his other perfections, and that this is Abſolutely full Goodneſs.

      * 2. That that which is moſt pretious and beſt (as I may ſo ſpeak) in the Divine Nature, will be ſure to work firſt, and extend it ſelf to all the capacities and poſſibilities of things.

      * 3. Concluſion. That the Divine eſtimate of things and perſons, is according to the truth and reality of their reſpective Natures; and that when God makes judgment of Intellectual Creatures he does it by viewing their moral frame and conſtitution, and accordingly ſtands more or leſs affected towards them.

      * 4. Concluſion. That all the reſults, operations and deſigns of the Deity, relating to and terminated upon ſomething without him, are the emanations and effects of Abſolute and Compleat Goodneſs.

    _ CHAP. II. Abſolute Reprobation repugnant to Right Reaſon: wherein is ſet out the Moral Nature of our Souls in reference to Good and Evil, Truth, and Falſhood. And this Second Argument made good in Four Propoſitions.

      * 2. To determine by an abſolute and poſitive act the Happineſs of ſome,Prop. 2. and the Miſery of others, and yet to Decree the ſame upon condition of their Obedience or Diſobedience, is inconſiſtent with the light of Reaſon.

      * 3.Prop. 3. To command men to Act according to a Law under a certain and ſevere Puniſhment, and yet to take away all Power and Ability of Acting according to the Tenor of that Law, is contrary to the dictates of Right Reaſon.

      * 4.Prop. 4. That to Create and bring into Being on purpoſe to deſtroy and make miſerable, is moſt irrational.

      * 1. That there is ſomething Soveraign in the Deity, which is the root and ſpring of all his other perfections, and that this is Abſolutely full Goodneſs.

      * 2. That that which is moſt pretious and beſt (as I may ſo ſpeak) in the Divine Nature, will be ſure to work firſt, and extend it ſelf to all the capacities and poſſibilities of things.

      * 3. Concluſion. That the Divine eſtimate of things and perſons, is according to the truth and reality of their reſpective Natures; and that when God makes judgment of Intellectual Creatures he does it by viewing their moral frame and conſtitution, and accordingly ſtands more or leſs affected towards them.

      * 4. Concluſion. That all the reſults, operations and deſigns of the Deity, relating to and terminated upon ſomething without him, are the emanations and effects of Abſolute and Compleat Goodneſs.
